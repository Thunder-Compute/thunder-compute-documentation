## Networking

- Egress/Ingress: 7-10Gbps
- IP: dynamic
- Region: U.S. Central (Iowa)
- E or N series CPU instances in GCP

## Storage
### Persistent Disk

By default, all instances use persistent disks. This enables a "stopped" state where data persists but compute usage is paused.

To stop all billing, delete instances that are no longer in use.

While we don't provide explicit guarantees, you can generally expect ~100k IOPS and 1200 Mbps Read/Write.

### Snapshots

Snapshots provide a cheaper option for long-term storage, compressed to eliminate unused space.

You can also use snapshots to create new instances with the same data as existing instances.

To take a snapshot, stop your instance and use the snapshot feature in the console or CLI. This process typically takes ~2-3 minutes.

## Inactive-Instance Data Retention

Thunder Compute retains the persistent storage associated with an account for 60 days after the last time any instance in that account was running.
- If an account has been inactive for 60 consecutive days (defined by no running instances), all attached volumes, snapshots, and other instance-specific data are irreversibly deleted.
- This retention window applies per account (not per individual instance). Starting or stopping any instance resets the 60-day timer.
- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Back up any critical data before the retention period ends.
- Aggregated billing, usage, and audit logs are retained according to our standard privacy policy and are not affected by this rule.
