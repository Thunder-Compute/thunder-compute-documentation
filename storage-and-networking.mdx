## Networking

- Egress/Ingress: 7-10Gbps
- IP: dynamic
- Region: U.S. Central (Iowa)
- E or N series CPU instances in GCP

## Storage
### Persistent Disk

By default, all instances use persistent disks. This enables a "stopped" state where data persists but compute usage is paused.

To stop all billing, delete instances that are no longer in use.

We do not guarantee storage performance, but you can generally expect ~100k IOPS and 1200 Mbps Read/Write

## Inactive-Instance Data Retention

Thunder Compute retains the persistent storage associated with an account for 60 days after the last time any instance in that account was running.
- If no instance has been in the Running state for 60 consecutive days, all attached volumes, snapshots, and other instance-specific data are irreversibly deleted.
- This retention window applies per account (not per individual instance). Starting or stopping any instance resets the 60-day timer.
- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Back up any critical data before the retention period ends.
- Aggregated billing, usage, and audit logs are retained according to our standard privacy policy and are not affected by this rule.
