Snapshots capture the full disk state of a running instance, letting you restore your environment later without re-installing dependencies or re-downloading models.

You can also use snapshots to change the GPU type of an instance by taking a snapshot and re-creating with new specs.

<Note>
  Snapshots are currently in beta. Share feedback on [Discord](https://discord.gg/nwuETS9jJK) or email support@thundercompute.com.

## Why Use Snapshots?

- **Save your environment** – Capture installed packages, models, and configurations
- **Faster setup** – Spin up new instances from a known-good state
- **Modify specs** – Create a new instance with the same disk

## Create a Snapshot

To create a snapshot, use the interactive menu:

```bash
tnr snapshot create
```

Or specify the instance and name directly:

```bash
tnr snapshot create --instance-id 0 --name my-environment
```

## List Your Snapshots

View all your snapshots with their status, size, and creation date:

```bash
tnr snapshot list
```

Once your snapshot is ready, it is safe to delete your existing instance.

Status values:
- **READY** – Snapshot is complete and can be used
- **CREATING** – Snapshot is still being created
- **FAILED** – Snapshot creation failed

## Restore from a Snapshot

When you create a new instance, your snapshots appear alongside templates in the selection menu:

```bash
tnr create
```

In the interactive menu, look below the templates to see **Custom Snapshots**. Select one to create an instance with that saved state.

The new instance's disk size must be at least as large as the snapshot. The CLI enforces this automatically.

<Note>
  Restoring from a snapshot may take about 10 minutes per 100GB of data. The instance will show as "RESTORING" during this time.
</Note>

## Delete a Snapshot

Remove snapshots you no longer need:

```bash
# Interactive selection
tnr snapshot delete

# Delete by name
tnr snapshot delete my-environment
```

<Warning>
  Deleting a snapshot is permanent and cannot be undone.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

1. **Name snapshots descriptively** – Include the project, date, or purpose (e.g., `llama-finetuned-jan2026`)

2. **Snapshot before major changes** – Create a snapshot before installing new packages or modifying your environment

3. **Clean up unused snapshots** – Snapshots count toward your storage. Delete old ones you no longer need

4. **Keep snapshots small** – Remove large temporary files before creating a snapshot to speed up creation and restoration

## Snapshots vs External Backups

Snapshots are great for quickly restoring your environment, but they're tied to Thunder Compute. For long-term data preservation, also use:

- **GitHub** for code and configuration
- **Local downloads** for important outputs
- **Cloud storage** (R2, Google Drive) for large files
