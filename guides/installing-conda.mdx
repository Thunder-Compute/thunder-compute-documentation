Miniforge is the recommended installer for Conda from the conda-forge project. It includes conda, mamba, and their dependencies. On Thunder Compute instances, you **must use Miniforge** as other Conda distributions (like Anaconda or Miniconda) may have compatibility issues with system libraries.

## Installation Steps

### Create a new instance

1. Create a new instance by following the steps in the [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.thundercompute.com/docs/quickstart) and connect to it.

### Install Miniforge

1. Download the Miniforge installer:

```bash
curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
```

2. Install Miniforge:

```bash
bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
# Accept the license agreement (Enter, Q, Enter)
# Confirm the installation location (yes)
# Allow the installer to initialize Miniforge3 (yes)
```

3. Activate the installation:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
