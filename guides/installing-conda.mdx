Miniforge is the recommended installer for Conda from the conda-forge project. It includes conda, mamba, and their dependencies. On Thunder Compute instances, you **must use Miniforge** as other Conda distributions (like Anaconda or Miniconda) may have compatibility issues with system libraries. For more details about system compatibility, see our [compatibility guide](/docs/compatibility).

## Installation Steps

### Create a new instance

1. Create a new instance by following the steps in the [Quickstart Guide](https://www.thundercompute.com/docs/docs/quickstart) and connect to it. You can also use our [VSCode integration](/guides/vscode-integration-for-thunder-compute) for a better development experience.

### Install Miniforge

1. Download the Miniforge installer:

```bash
curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
```

2. Install Miniforge:

```bash
bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
# Accept the license agreement (Enter, Q, Enter)
# Confirm the installation location (yes)
# Allow the installer to initialize Miniforge3 (yes)
```

3. Activate the installation:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Once installed, you might want to check out our guide on [running Jupyter notebooks](/guides/running-jupyter-notebooks-on-thunder-compute) to start using your Conda environment for data science and machine learning tasks.
