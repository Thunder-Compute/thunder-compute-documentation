### 1. Connect to VSCode
Follow the instructions in our [Using Thunder Compute with VSCode](https://docs.thundercompute.com/guides/vscode-integration-for-thunder-compute) to set up your remote instance in VSCode.

Next, ensure you have the "Jupyter Notebook" VSCode extension.

### 2. Install the Jupyter extension in VSCode

Navigate to the extensions store and install the Jupyter extension within your cloud instance

### 3. Verify GPU availability in the notebook

Create a Jupyter Notebook, which is now connected to a Thunder Compute instance with GPU capabilities. To confirm that the GPU is accessible, run the following code in a notebook cell:

```
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())
```

If the setup is correct, the output should be:

```
true
```

That's it! You are connected to a notebook running in a Thunder Compute instance.
