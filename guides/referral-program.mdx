## How It Works

Our referral program rewards you with **3% of every dollar** your referrals spend on GPU instances. Here's what you need to know:

- **Reward Rate:** 3% of all spending by referred users
- **Duration:** Lifetime rewards for each referred customer
- **Credits:** Paid out in Thunder Compute credits (non-transferable)
- **Tracking:** Credits appear automatically within minutes of payment

## Getting Started

### 1. Find Your Referral Link

1. Sign in to the [Thunder Compute Console](https://console.thundercompute.com/)
2. Navigate to **Settings › General**
3. Copy your unique referral link
4. Share it anywhere—social media, tutorials, blog posts, or direct messages

### 2. Share and Earn

Once someone creates a new account using your link and starts spending on GPU instances, you'll automatically earn 3% of their payments as credits.
