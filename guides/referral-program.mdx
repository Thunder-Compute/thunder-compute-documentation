**Refer a friend, earn credit.** Share your unique referral link and receive credits every time someone you refer spends on Thunder Compute GPUs.

<Note>
  This program is currently in beta. Terms may evolve as we improve the program based on user feedback.

## How It Works

Our referral program rewards you with **3% of every dollar** your referrals spend on GPU instances. Here's what you need to know:

- **Reward Rate:** 3% of all spending by referred users
- **Duration:** Lifetime rewards for each referred customer
- **Credits:** Paid out in Thunder Compute credits (non-transferable)
- **Tracking:** Credits apply to paid, consumed compute resources. These typically post within minutes of a finalized invoice for consumed compute.

We created this program as a way to give back to our community. Rather than paying advertisers, we want to reward you for your contribution to Thunder Compute.

By referring even a medium-size startup you can often receive thousands of dollars of free compute.

## Getting Started

### 1. Find Your Referral Link

1. Sign in to the [Thunder Compute Console](https://console.thundercompute.com/)
2. Navigate to **Settings › General**
3. Copy your unique referral link
4. Share it anywhere—social media, tutorials, blog posts, or direct messages

### 2. Share and Earn

Once someone creates a new account using your link and starts using GPU instances, you'll automatically earn 3% of their payments as credits.
