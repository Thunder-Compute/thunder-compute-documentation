<Warning>
  Manually SSHing is an advanced escape hatch. Thunder Compute already handles SSH, port forwarding, and key rotation through the **CLI**, **VS Code extension**, and **console**. Stick to the standard connect flows unless you have existing infrastructure that relies on raw SSH.
</Warning>

## Save an SSH key once

- **Console:** open [Authentication → SSH Keys (Advanced)](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings/ssh) to add or remove organization keys.
- **CLI:** run `tnr ssh-keys add` to launch the interactive picker. The CLI autodetects keys in `~/.ssh/*.pub`, so you just confirm the one you want. Use `tnr ssh-keys list` anytime to verify what is saved.

Saved keys live at the org level, so everyone on your team can reuse them when creating instances.

## Use saved keys when you create instances

- **CLI:** pass `--ssh-keys <name>` to `tnr create`. The CLI links your local private key for your reference, but `tnr connect` does not reuse these keys.
- **VS Code:** the create-instance dialog now lets you pick any key from your saved list; new windows reuse it automatically.
- **Console:** launching from the web UI lets you choose a saved key during creation.

Instances include the selected public key in `authorized_keys` at boot. You can add keys later by manually connecting with `ssh` or by using the [Add SSH key to instance](http://localhost:3000/api-reference/instances/add-ssh-key-to-instance) API reference. These saved keys are separate from the credentials Thunder Compute uses for `tnr connect`, which maintains its own managed access.

## SSH manually

1. Find the instance IP and SSH port from either the console details pane (click the instance row) or the table output of `tnr status`.

   ```bash
   tnr status
   ```

   Instance IPs stay the same for the life of the VM, but confirm the SSH port each time you reconnect.

2. From your local machine, run SSH with the private key that matches the saved public key, the reported port, and the `ubuntu` user:

   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -p <port> ubuntu@<instance-ip>
   ```

   Replace `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` with the private key path you selected earlier. Substitute `<port>` with the value from instance details. Most images use the `ubuntu` user; check your template if it differs.

3. Optional: copy the command into editors such as JetBrains Gateway or any remote-SSH client.

## Quick troubleshooting

- **Permission denied:** make sure you are connecting as `ubuntu`, using the `-p <port>` from instance details, and that the matching private key exists locally (the CLI will warn if it cannot link it).
- **Connection timed out:** re-check that you copied the correct port; the IP stays stable, but the exposed port can change if the instance is cycled.
- **Host verification failed:** remove the old entry from `~/.ssh/known_hosts` and retry. New IPs will change fingerprints.
- **Still stuck?** Double-check the IP, port, and key, or send a message in [Discord](https://discord.gg/thundercompute) with the SSH output.
