<Warning>
  Thunder Compute is designed to eliminate the need for manually SSHing. For most users, you will want to 'Connect' to instances with our **CLI** or **VS Code extension.**
  \
  \
  Under the hood, we wrap SSH setup, key management, and port-forwarding for your convenience. See the [Quick-Start guide](/quickstart) for a full walkthrough.
</Warning>

Some custom setups may require direct SSH access, for example, setting up remote-ssh in an unsupported editor. If this describes your use, read on. 

## 1. Manually SSH into Thunder Compute

To manually SSH into your Thunder Compute instance:

1. **Connect once with the CLI** to set up your SSH configuration:

   ```bash
   tnr connect
   ```

   This automatically adds your instance as `tnr-0` in your SSH config and sets up the necessary keys.
2. **SSH directly** using the configured alias:

   ```bash
   ssh tnr-0
   ```
3. **Use with other IDEs**: You can also use `tnr-0` with other remote SSH tools like VS Code Remote-SSH, JetBrains Gateway, or any SSH-compatible IDE.

That's it\! The CLI handles all the key management and configuration for you.

## 2. Troubleshooting SSH Errors

When you run `tnr connect`, the tool SSHs into your instance automatically. If something goes wrong, you might see errors such as:

- **Bad permissions** – _"Try removing permissions for user: \\OWNER RIGHTS (S-1-3-4) on file C:\\Users\<your_username\>.ssh\\config."_
- **Error reading SSH protocol banner** (often means the instance is out of memory and the SSH handshake cannot complete).
- **Key authentication failed** (your SSH key is outdated or misconfigured).

Follow the steps below to fix the problem.

### A. Recreate the Instance

The quickest fix is often to back up any critical files, delete the instance, and create a new one. This gives you a fresh environment without lingering SSH state.

### B. Test a Manual SSH Connection

Get a more detailed error message by bypassing `tnr connect`:

```bash
ssh tnr-0
```

### C. Fix Common Issues

#### Out-of-Memory

If you see **Error reading SSH protocol banner**, the instance may have run out of RAM. Wait a few seconds and retry. For a permanent fix, launch an instance with more resources:

```bash
tnr create --vcpus 8
```

_Tip: 16–32 vCPUs generally provide enough memory for most ML workloads._

#### Permissions Problems

<CodeGroup>

```powershell Windows
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
icacls "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\config" /reset
icacls "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\config" /inheritance:r
Rename-Item -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\config" -NewName 'config.old'
```


```bash MacOS
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
chown $(whoami) ~/.ssh/config
mv ~/.ssh/config ~/.ssh/config.old
```


```bash Linux/WSL
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
chown $(whoami) ~/.ssh/config
mv ~/.ssh/config ~/.ssh/config.old
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Corrupted Known-Hosts or Thunder Compute Locks

**Known-Hosts**

<CodeGroup>

```powershell Windows
Rename-Item -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\known_hosts" -NewName 'known_hosts.old'
```


```bash MacOS
mv ~/.ssh/known_hosts ~/.ssh/known_hosts.old
```


```bash Linux/WSL
mv ~/.ssh/known_hosts ~/.ssh/known_hosts.old
```

</CodeGroup>

**Thunder Compute Locks & Keys**

<CodeGroup>

```powershell Windows
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.thunder\locks"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.thunder\keys"
```


```bash MacOS
rm -rf ~/.thunder/locks ~/.thunder/keys
```


```bash Linux/WSL
rm -rf ~/.thunder/locks ~/.thunder/keys
```

</CodeGroup>

### D. Reinstall the Thunder Compute CLI or VS Code Extension

If the steps above do not resolve the error, reinstalling the tooling often does:

1. Remove the existing CLI or extension.
2. Download the latest installer from [Thunder Compute download](https://console.thundercompute.com/?download).
3. Re-run `tnr login` followed by `tnr connect`.

### E. Still Having Issues?

Open a ticket in our [Discord support channel](https://discord.gg/thundercompute) with the exact error output, and we will get you unblocked fast.

Happy troubleshooting\!
