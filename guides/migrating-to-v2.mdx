Weâ€™re officially on **v2** of Thunder Computeâ€™s infrastructure ðŸŽ‰ ðŸš€

**Whatâ€™s new**

- **Faster** CPUs, networking, and GPUs (often by large margins)
- **More reliable** start/stop/connect operations
- **Coming soon**: H100s, 8Ã— GPU nodes, and more GPU types

## Migrate in 3 steps

1. **Create a new instance**

With the browser, CLI, or VS Code extension, create a new instance. All new instances are automatically on v2.

```bash
tnr create
```

2. **Copy files from your old instance**

First, connect to the old instance:

```bash
tnr connect <old-id>
```

Then, install the thunder CLI within your old instance.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://console.thundercompute.com/install.sh | sh
```

From within the old instance, connect to the new instance.
```bash
tnr connect <new-id>
```

Exit from the new instance, staying in the old instance.

```bash

3. **Use rsync to transfer files**

```bash
rsync -avhz --progress tnr-<old-id>:~/ tnr-<new-id>:~/
```

Notes:

- You can scope to specific directories, e.g., `tnr-<old-id>:~/project/` to `tnr-<new-id>:~/project/`.
- Run the command from your local computer; the `tnr-<id>` SSH configs are created on first connect.
- To mirror exactly (including deletions), add `--delete` (use with care).

3. **Delete old instances and snapshots** (after verifying the new instance)

```bash
tnr stop <old-id>
tnr delete <old-id>
tnr snapshot delete <old-snapshot-id>
```

## Compatibility

Please note that Docker and systemd are not currently supported on Thunder Compute v2. We plan to release functionality to directly deploy containers as instances in the near future.
