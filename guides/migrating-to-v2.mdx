Weâ€™re officially on **v2** of Thunder Computeâ€™s infrastructure ðŸŽ‰ ðŸš€

**Whatâ€™s new**

- **Faster** CPUs, networking, and GPUs (often by large margins)
- **More reliable** start/stop/connect operations
- **Coming soon**: H100s, 8Ã— GPU nodes, and more GPU types

## Migrate in 3 steps

1. **Create a new instance**

With the browser, CLI, or VS Code extension, create a new instance. All new instances are automatically on v2.

2. **Copy files from your old instance**

First, create SSH aliases for both instances (this happens on first connect):

```bash
tnr connect <old-id>
tnr connect <new-id>
```

Then use `rsync` from your local machine to transfer directly between the two instances. This resumes partial transfers and shows progress:

```bash
rsync -avhz --partial --inplace --progress tnr-<old-id>:~/ tnr-<new-id>:~/
```

Notes:

- You can scope to specific directories, e.g., `tnr-<old-id>:~/project/` to `tnr-<new-id>:~/project/`.
- Run the command from your local computer; the `tnr-<id>` SSH configs are created on first connect.
- To mirror exactly (including deletions), add `--delete` (use with care).

3. **Delete old instances and snapshots** (after verifying the new instance)

```bash
tnr stop <old-id>
tnr delete <old-id>
tnr snapshot delete <old-snapshot-id>
```

## Compatibility

Please note that Docker and systemd are not currently supported on Thunder Compute v2. We plan to release functionality to directly deploy containers as instances in the near future.
