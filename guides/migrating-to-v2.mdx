Weâ€™re officially on **v2** of Thunder Computeâ€™s infrastructure ðŸŽ‰ ðŸš€

**Whatâ€™s new**

- **Faster** CPUs, networking, and GPUs (often by large margins)
- **More reliable** start/stop/connect operations
- **Coming soon**: H100s, 8Ã— GPU nodes, and more GPU types

## Migrate in 3 steps

1) **Create a new instance**

With the browser, CLI, or VS Code extension, create a new instance. All new instances are automatically on v2.

2) **Copy files from your old instance**

First, create SSH aliases for both instances (this happens on first connect):

```bash
tnr connect <old-id>
tnr connect <new-id>
```

Then use `rsync` from your local machine to transfer directly between the two instances. This resumes partial transfers and shows progress:

```bash
rsync -avhz --partial --inplace --progress tnr-<old-id>:~/ tnr-<new-id>:~/
```

Notes:

- You can scope to specific directories, e.g., `tnr-<old-id>:~/project/` to `tnr-<new-id>:~/project/`.
- Run the command from your local computer; the `tnr-<id>` SSH configs are created on first connect.
- To mirror exactly (including deletions), add `--delete` (use with care).

3) **Delete old instances and snapshots** (after verifying the new instance)

```bash
tnr stop <old-id>
tnr delete <old-id>
tnr snapshot delete <old-snapshot-id>
```

## Advanced: Faster transfer

For large datasets, you can transfer directly between instances (bypassing your local machine) for better performance:

1. **Set up tnr CLI on the old instance**

   Connect to your old instance and install the tnr CLI:

   ```bash
   tnr connect <old-id>
   curl -fsSL https://console.thundercompute.com/install.sh | sh
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. **Connect to the new instance from the old instance**

   While still on the old instance, connect to the new instance to create the SSH alias:

   ```bash
   tnr connect <new-id>
   ```

3. **Transfer directly**

   Now run the transfer from the old instance:

   ```bash
   rsync -avhz --partial --inplace --progress ~/ tnr-<new-id>:~/
   ```

This method uses the direct network connection between instances, which is typically faster than routing through your local machine.

4. **Delete old instances and snapshots** (after verifying the new instance)

   ```bash
   tnr stop <old-id>
   tnr delete <old-id>
   tnr snapshot delete <old-snapshot-id>
   ```

## Compatibility

Please note that Docker and systemd are not currently supported on Thunder Compute v2. We plan to release functionality to directly deploy containers as instances in the near future.
