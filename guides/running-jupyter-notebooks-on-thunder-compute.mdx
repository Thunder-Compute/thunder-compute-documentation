## Prerequisites for a Jupyter Notebook with Cloud GPU

- VSCode installed
- Thunder Compute extension installed in VSCode or Cursor
- Jupyter Notebook extension installed in VSCode or Cursor

## Steps to Launch Your Notebook

### 1. Connect to a Thunder Compute cloud GPU in VSCode

Follow the instructions in our [Using Thunder Compute with VSCode](https://thundercompute.com/docs/guides/vscode-integration-for-thunder-compute) guide to set and connect to a remote instance in VSCode.

### 2. Install the Jupyter extension in your cloud workspace

Open the Extensions panel and install the Jupyter extension inside your Thunder Compute instance.

### 3. Verify GPU availability inside the notebook

Create a Jupyter Notebook, which is now connected to a Thunder Compute instance with GPU capabilities. To confirm that the GPU is accessible, run the following in a notebook cell:

```
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())
```

If everything is set up correctly, the output should be:

```
True
```

You now have a Jupyter Notebook running on a Thunder Compute cloud GPU, a fast and low-cost alternative to Colab for indie developers, researchers, and data scientists.
