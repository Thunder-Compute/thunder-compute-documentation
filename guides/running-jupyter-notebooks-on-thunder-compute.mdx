## Prerequisites

- VSCode installed
- The Thunder Compute extension installed in VSCode or Cursor
- The Jupyter Notebook extension installed in VSCode or Cursor

## Steps

### Connect to a Thunder Compute instance in VSCode
Follow the instructions in our [Using Thunder Compute with VSCode](https://thundercompute.com/docs/guides/vscode-integration-for-thunder-compute) to set and connect to a remote instance in VSCode.

### Install the Jupyter extension in VSCode

Navigate to the extensions store and install the Jupyter extension within your cloud instance

### Verify GPU availability in the notebook

Create a Jupyter Notebook, which is now connected to a Thunder Compute instance with GPU capabilities. To confirm that the GPU is accessible, run the following code in a notebook cell:

```
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())
```

If the setup is correct, the output should be:

```
true
```

That's it! You are connected to a notebook running in a Thunder Compute instance.
