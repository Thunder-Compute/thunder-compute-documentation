# Cheapest Way to Run DeepSeek R1 on Thunder Compute

Looking for the **cheapest way to run DeepSeek R1** or just want to **try DeepSeek R1** without buying hardware? Thunder Compute lets you spin up pay‑per‑minute A100 GPUs so you only pay for the time you use. Follow the steps below to get the model running in minutes.

> **Quick reminder:** Make sure your Thunder Compute account is set up. If not, start with our [Quickstart Guide](https://thundercompute.com/docs/docs/quickstart).

## Step 1: Create a Cost‑Effective GPU Instance

Open your CLI and launch an 80 GB A100 GPU (perfect for the 70B variant):

```bash
tnr create --gpu "a100xl" --template "ollama"
```

For details on instance templates, see our [templates guide](/guides/using-instance-templates).

## Step 2: Check Status and Connect

Verify the instance is running:

```bash
tnr status
```

Connect with its ID:

```bash
tnr connect <instance-id>
```

## Step 3: Start the Ollama Server

Inside the instance, start Ollama:

```bash
start ollama
```

If you hit any hiccups, check our [troubleshooting guide](/docs/troubleshooting).

Wait about 30 seconds for the web UI to load.

## Step 4: Access the Web UI and Load DeepSeek R1

1. Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.  
2. Choose **DeepSeek R1** from the dropdown. On an 80 GB A100, pick the **70B** variant for peak performance.

## Step 5: Run DeepSeek R1

Type a prompt in the web interface. For example:

> *"If the concepts of rCUDA were applied at scale, overcoming latency, what would it mean for the cost of GPUs on cloud providers?"*

The model will think through the answer and respond. A full reply can take up to 200 seconds.
