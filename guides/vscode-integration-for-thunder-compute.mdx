Boost your workflow with Thunder Compute’s easy cloud GPUs for development. In a few clicks you can code, train, or render with a full-featured GPU directly inside VSCode or Cursor.

## Prerequisites

- An active Thunder Compute account with cloud GPU credits  
- Visual Studio Code (or Cursor) installed

## Steps

### 1. Install the Thunder Compute extension

Choose the right marketplace link to add Thunder Compute to your IDE:

- [Thunder Compute VSCode extension](vscode:extension/ThunderCompute.thunder-compute)  
- [Thunder Compute Cursor extension](cursor:extension/ThunderCompute.thunder-compute)

### 2. Create a cloud GPU instance

Open the **Thunder Compute** tab in the sidebar and press the **Create Instance** button (plus icon) to spin up a cheap cloud GPU for developing.

### 3. Connect VSCode to your cloud GPU

Hit **Connect** next to the instance (double-arrow icon). VSCode now tunnels into the remote GPU so every terminal, debugger, and extension acts like it's running locally.

You’re all set - develop, test, or fine-tune models with a GPU in the cloud while keeping the familiar feel of your local editor.
