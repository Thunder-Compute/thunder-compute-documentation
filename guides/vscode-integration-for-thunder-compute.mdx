### Connect to the Thunder Compute instance

Navigate to the Remote Explorer on the left sidebar in VSCode. You should see your instance listed as `tnr-0`. If you just created your instance, you may have to wait up to 5 minutes for this to appear.

Note: if the instance is stopped it will not appear in Remote Explorer. Use the command `$ tnr start <instance_id>` to start it and wait for it to re-appear.

In the Remote Explorer, click the arrow to connect to the instance. Once connected, your screen should look like the image below:

## Conclusion

You have successfully connected VSCode to your Thunder Compute instance. You can now develop as if you are locally attached to a virtual GPU.
