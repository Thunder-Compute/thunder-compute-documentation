Thunder Compute gives indie developers, researchers, and data-scientists low-cost cloud GPUs in a few clicks. Our **CLI** (`tnr`) and **VS Code extension** wrap SSH setup, key management, and port-forwarding for you—see the [Quick-Start guide](https://www.thundercompute.com/docs/quickstart) for a full walkthrough.

When you run `tnr connect`, the tool SSHs into your instance automatically. If something goes wrong, you might see errors such as:

- **Bad permissions** – _"Try removing permissions for user: \\OWNER RIGHTS (S-1-3-4) on file C:\\Users\<your_username\>.ssh\\config."_
- **Error reading SSH protocol banner** (often means the instance is out of memory and the SSH handshake cannot complete).
- **Key authentication failed** (your SSH key is outdated or misconfigured).

Follow the steps below to fix the problem.

## 1. Restart the Instance

A quick restart clears many transient issues:

```bash
tnr stop
tnr start
```

Wait about a minute, then try `tnr connect` again.

## 2. Test a Manual SSH Connection

Get a more detailed error message by bypassing `tnr connect`:

```bash
ssh tnr-0
```

## 3. Fix Common Issues

### A. Out-of-Memory

If you see **Error reading SSH protocol banner**, the instance may have run out of RAM. Wait a few seconds and retry. For a permanent fix, launch an instance with more resources:

```bash
tnr create --vcpus 8
```

_Tip: 16–32 vCPUs generally provide enough memory for most ML workloads._

### B. Permissions Problems

<CodeGroup>

```powershell [Windows]
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
icacls "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\config" /reset
icacls "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\config" /inheritance:r
Rename-Item -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\config" -NewName 'config.old'
```


```bash [macOS]
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
chown $(whoami) ~/.ssh/config
mv ~/.ssh/config ~/.ssh/config.old
```


```bash [Linux/WSL]
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
chown $(whoami) ~/.ssh/config
mv ~/.ssh/config ~/.ssh/config.old
```

</CodeGroup>

### C. Corrupted Known-Hosts or Thunder Compute Locks

#### Known-Hosts

<CodeGroup>

```powershell [Windows]
Rename-Item -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\known_hosts" -NewName 'known_hosts.old'
```


```bash [macOS]
mv ~/.ssh/known_hosts ~/.ssh/known_hosts.old
```


```bash [Linux/WSL]
mv ~/.ssh/known_hosts ~/.ssh/known_hosts.old
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Thunder Compute Locks & Keys

<CodeGroup>

```powershell [Windows]
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.thunder\locks"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.thunder\keys"
```


```bash [macOS]
rm -rf ~/.thunder/locks ~/.thunder/keys
```


```bash [Linux/WSL]
rm -rf ~/.thunder/locks ~/.thunder/keys
```

</CodeGroup>

## 4. Reinstall the Thunder Compute CLI or VS Code Extension

If the steps above do not resolve the error, reinstalling the tooling often does:

1. Remove the existing CLI or extension.
2. Download the latest installer from [Thunder Compute download](https://console.thundercompute.com/?download).
3. Re-run `tnr login` followed by `tnr connect`.

## 5. Still Having Issues?
