## The Workflow

Thunder Compute does not have a native "Stop" feature for instances. Fortunately, you can achieve the same result by using snapshots. 

To "stop" an instance, follow these three steps:

1. **Create a snapshot:** This saves the current state of the running instance.

2. **Delete the instance:** Once snapshot creation is underway, you can safely delete the running instance.

3. **Restore the snapshot:** Create a new instance by using your saved Snapshot as the template.

### 1. Create a Snapshot
First, capture the current state of your running instance. You can trigger this through any of our supported interfaces:


**Guides:** [VS Code](https://www.thundercompute.com/docs/vscode/operations/snapshots#create-a-snapshot) | [CLI](https://www.thundercompute.com/docs/cli/operations/snapshots#create-a-snapshot) | [Console](https://www.thundercompute.com/docs/console/operations/snapshots#create-a-snapshot)

### 2. Delete the Running Instance
Once the snapshot is initiated, delete the instance.

**Guides:** [VS Code](/vscode/operations/deleting-instances#delete-an-instance) | [CLI](/cli/operations/deleting-instances#delete-an-instance) | [Console](/console/operations/deleting-instances#delete-an-instance)

<Tip>
  You can delete your instance immediately after triggering the snapshot.
</Tip>

### 3. Restore from Snapshot
When you are ready to resume, create a new instance using your snapshot as the base.

## Important Notes

<Warning>
The time required to create and restore snapshots varies based on the size of the snapshot.
</Warning>

* **Cost Efficiency:** You only pay for the snapshot storage while the instance is deleted; significantly cheaper than keeping an instance running.
* **IP Addresses:** Recreating an instance from a snapshot will likely result in a new IP address. Remember to update your connection settings accordingly.
