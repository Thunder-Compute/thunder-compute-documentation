# Fixing 'tnr not found' Error

If you encounter the error `'tnr not found'`, it usually means your system can't find the `tnr` command because Python's scripts directory isn't in your PATH environment variable.

Follow these simple steps to add Python's scripts directory to your PATH:

<CodeGroup>

```powershell Windows
# Open PowerShell as administrator and run:
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";" + "$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonXX\Scripts", [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
```

Replace `PythonXX` with your Python version (e.g., Python311 for Python 3.11).

Restart your terminal or computer to apply changes.

```bash macOS
# Open Terminal and run:
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$(python3 -m site --user-base)/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Restart your terminal to apply changes.

```bash Linux
# Open Terminal and run:
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$(python3 -m site --user-base)/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Restart your terminal to apply changes.

</CodeGroup>

## Verify the Fix

After updating your PATH, verify the fix by running:

```bash
tnr --version
```

If you see the version number, you're all set!
