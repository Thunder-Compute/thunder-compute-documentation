Weights & Biases (wandb) is an experiment tracking and model management platform that’s particularly useful when training large models on Cloud GPUs. It helps you:

- Track training runs, hyperparameters, and metrics
- Monitor GPU/CPU utilization in real time
- Version datasets and model checkpoints
- Run large-scale hyperparameter sweeps across many GPU instances

On Thunder Compute, wandb helps you monitor GPU utilization, identify bottlenecks, and track training metrics.

---

## Prerequisites

- A Thunder Compute GPU instance created and connected
- Python environment set up on your instance
- A Weights & Biases account (https://wandb.ai)

---

## Installation

Install wandb on your Thunder Compute instance:

```bash
pip install wandb
```

Or add to a `requirements.txt`:

```bash
echo "wandb" >> requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Authentication

Authenticate with:

```bash
wandb login
```

Or via environment variable:

```bash
export WANDB_API_KEY="your_api_key"
wandb login --relogin
```

You will see the following below:

```
wandb: Logging into wandb.ai. (Learn how to deploy a W&B server locally: https://wandb.me/wandb-server)
wandb: You can find your API key in your browser here: https://wandb.ai/authorize?ref=models
wandb: Paste an API key from your profile and hit enter, or press ctrl+c to quit:
```

Enter your API key which can be found on the homepage of wandb.ai after you create an account, once entered you will see:

```
wandb: No netrc file found, creating one.
wandb: Appending key for api.wandb.ai to your netrc file: /home/ubuntu/.netrc
wandb: Currently logged in as: username (entity-name) to https://api.wandb.ai. Use `wandb login --relogin` to force relogin
```

<Note>
  For shared or production Thunder instances, environment variables or secret
  managers are preferred over pasting API keys directly.
</Note>

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run your first wandb experiment on your Thunder Compute instance.

### Step 1 — Create a Training File

Create a new Python file on your instance:

```bash
nano train.py
```

Or create a new file within your IDE connected over SSH.

### Step 2 — Paste Minimal Working Example

Copy this minimal example into your `train.py` file:

```python
import wandb
import time

# Initialize wandb
wandb.init(
    project="thunder-resnet",
    name="quick-test",
    config={
        "learning_rate": 0.001,
        "batch_size": 32,
        "epochs": 5,
    },
)

# Simple training loop simulation
for epoch in range(5):
    # Simulate training metrics
    train_loss = 1.0 / (epoch + 1)
    train_acc = 0.5 + epoch * 0.1

    # Log metrics to wandb
    wandb.log({
        "epoch": epoch,
        "train/loss": train_loss,
        "train/accuracy": train_acc,
    })

    time.sleep(0.5)  # Simulate work

wandb.finish()
```

### Step 3 — Run the Script

Execute your training script:

```bash
python train.py
```

### Step 4 — Expected Output

You should see output similar to:

```
wandb: Currently logged in as: your-username (entity-name) to https://api.wandb.ai. Use `wandb login --relogin` to force relogin
wandb: Tracking run with wandb version 0.23.0

```

### Step 5 — View Your Results

1. **View your dashboard**: Click the link in the output or visit https://wandb.ai and navigate to your project
2. **View in Table view**: Go to **(Project Name)** > **Projects** > **thunder-resnet** > **Table** to see all your runs in a tabular format
3. **Compare runs**: Run the script multiple times with different configurations to compare results
4. **Add artifacts**: See the [Model Checkpointing with Weights & Biases Artifacts](#model-checkpointing-with-weights--biases-artifacts) section to version checkpoints and datasets
5. **Scale to multi-GPU**: Check out [Distributed Training](#distributed-training-ddp-lightning-deepspeed) for multi-GPU setups
6. **Run sweeps**: Use [Hyperparameter Sweeps](#hyperparameter-sweeps-multi‑gpu-multi‑instance) for automated hyperparameter search

## Core Concepts for Cloud GPU Workloads

When using remote GPUs, these wandb features matter most:

1. **Run tracking** — metrics, hyperparameters, logs
2. **GPU/system monitoring** — GPU utilization, power, memory, CPU load
3. **Artifacts** — versioned checkpoints and datasets
4. **Sweeps** — distributed hyperparameter search
5. **Groups & jobs** — organize multi-GPU/distributed training

---

## Basic Usage

### Initialize a Run

```python
import wandb

wandb.init(
    project="my-thunder-project",
    name="baseline-resnet50",
    config={
        "learning_rate": 3e-4,
        "batch_size": 64,
        "epochs": 20,
        "optimizer": "adamw",
        "precision": "fp16",
    },
)
```

### Log Metrics

```python
wandb.log({
    "train/loss": loss,
    "train/accuracy": acc,
    "step": step,
})
```

### Best Logging Practices

- Log every **N steps** (e.g., 10–50) to minimize overhead
- Avoid logging huge tensors every step
- Use artifacts for large files

---

## GPU & System Monitoring

Wandb automatically collects:

- GPU utilization
- GPU memory usage
- GPU temperature and power
- CPU usage
- RAM usage
- Disk and network I/O

Use these graphs to diagnose:

- **GPU-bound** workloads
- **Data-bound** workloads
- **Bottlenecks** due to I/O or preprocessing
- **Too-small batch sizes**

### Improving GPU Utilization

- Increase batch size until GPU memory is near capacity
- Use **mixed precision** (`torch.cuda.amp`)
- Increase dataloader workers
- Preload/augment data on the GPU
- Reduce unnecessary synchronizations

---

## Model Checkpointing with Weights & Biases Artifacts

When you train on Thunder Compute GPU instances, it's important that your model checkpoints are **not** tied to a single machine. Weights & Biases Artifacts provide a simple way to:

- Persist checkpoints even if the instance is deleted
- Move checkpoints between different Thunder instances (or GPU types)
- Share models with your team
- Reproduce and resume long-running training jobs

This section provides a walkthrough of how to do checkpointing with wandb.

---

### Why use Artifacts for checkpoints?

Saving checkpoints only to the local filesystem is risky:

- Thunder instances may be stopped or recreated
- You may want to resume training on a _different_ GPU (A100 → H100)
- Your team may need to reuse your model
- You may want versioned, reproducible training history

Artifacts solve this by storing checkpoints in W&B's managed, versioned storage.

---

### Step 1 — Save a checkpoint locally during training

Inside your real training loop, periodically save a checkpoint.  
For real projects (PyTorch):

```python
import torch

# ... inside your training loop ...
if (epoch + 1) % 5 == 0:
    ckpt_path = f"checkpoints/model_epoch_{epoch+1}.pt"
    torch.save(model.state_dict(), ckpt_path)
```

> It is best practice to save checkpoints inside a dedicated `checkpoints/` folder.

---

### Step 2 — Log the checkpoint as a W&B Artifact

Right after saving your file:

```python
import wandb

artifact = wandb.Artifact(
    name=f"resnet50-epoch-{epoch+1}",
    type="model",
    metadata={
        "epoch": epoch + 1,
        "val_loss": float(val_loss),
        "val_accuracy": float(val_acc),
    },
)

artifact.add_file(ckpt_path)
wandb.log_artifact(artifact)
```

This uploads your checkpoint to W&B and keeps a permanent copy.

---

### Step 3 — View & manage checkpoints in the W&B UI

1. Go to your wandb project
2. Open the **Artifacts** tab
3. Click your model artifact
4. You can now:
   - View version history (v0, v1, v2…)
   - Open the metrics/metadata
   - Download the checkpoint
   - Use it as an input for new runs

---

### Step 4 — Restore a checkpoint on another Thunder instance

On a fresh machine:

```python
import wandb
import torch

run = wandb.init(project="my-thunder-project", job_type="restore")

artifact = run.use_artifact(
    "wato/my-thunder-project/resnet50-epoch-10:latest",
    type="model",
)
artifact_dir = artifact.download()

checkpoint = torch.load(f"{artifact_dir}/model_epoch_10.pt", map_location="cuda")
model.load_state_dict(checkpoint)
model.to("cuda")
```

You now have the exact model weights from your previous run — even if the original instance is gone.

---

### Step 5 — Resume training

```python
model.load_state_dict(checkpoint)
model.to("cuda")

optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=3e-4)

start_epoch = 10
for epoch in range(start_epoch, config.epochs):
    train_one_epoch(...)
    validate(...)
    wandb.log({"epoch": epoch})
```

---

### Example: Adding Checkpointing to a Minimal `train.py`

Here is a working example using the simple training script from the Getting Started section.

This example simulates a checkpoint file (JSON), but the workflow is identical for real model weights.

```python
import wandb
import time
import json
import os

# Initialize wandb
wandb.init(
    project="thunder-resnet",
    name="quick-test",
    config={
        "learning_rate": 0.001,
        "batch_size": 32,
        "epochs": 5,
    },
)

os.makedirs("checkpoints", exist_ok=True)

for epoch in range(5):
    # Simulate training metrics
    train_loss = 1.0 / (epoch + 1)
    train_acc = 0.5 + epoch * 0.1

    # Log metrics to wandb
    wandb.log({
        "epoch": epoch,
        "train/loss": train_loss,
        "train/accuracy": train_acc,
    })

    # ---- Checkpointing Example ----
    # In a real project this would be torch.save(model.state_dict(), ...)
    checkpoint_path = f"checkpoints/epoch_{epoch}.json"
    with open(checkpoint_path, "w") as f:
        json.dump({
            "epoch": epoch,
            "train_loss": train_loss,
            "train_accuracy": train_acc,
        }, f)

    # Log checkpoint as an artifact
    artifact = wandb.Artifact(
        name=f"quick-test-epoch-{epoch}",
        type="model",
        metadata={
            "epoch": epoch,
            "train_loss": train_loss,
            "train_accuracy": train_acc
        },
    )
    artifact.add_file(checkpoint_path)
    wandb.log_artifact(artifact)
    # --------------------------------

    time.sleep(0.5)

wandb.finish()
```

This example demonstrates:

- how checkpoint files are created
- how they are logged as Artifacts
- how each epoch becomes a tracked, versioned checkpoint

These appear in the **Artifacts** tab of your project.

---

### Quick Reference: Other Artifact Types

Artifacts aren't just for model checkpoints. You can also version datasets:

```python
# Logging a Dataset
dataset = wandb.Artifact("imagenet-subset", type="dataset")
dataset.add_dir("data/imagenet_subset")
wandb.log_artifact(dataset)
```

---

## Hyperparameter Sweeps (Multi‑GPU, Multi‑Instance)

Sweeps allow large-scale hyperparameter search across many Thunder Compute instances.

### Step 1 — Create `sweep.yaml`

```yaml
program: train.py
project: thunder-resnet
method: bayes

metric:
  name: val/accuracy
  goal: maximize

parameters:
  learning_rate:
    min: 0.00001
    max: 0.001
  batch_size:
    values: [32, 64, 128]
  weight_decay:
    min: 0.0
    max: 0.1
  augment:
    values: ["none", "light", "heavy"]
```

Output:

```
wandb: Creating sweep from: sweep.yaml
wandb: Creating sweep with ID: fgbkmk3q
wandb: View sweep at: https://wandb.ai/entity-name/thunder-resnet/sweeps/fgbkmk3q
wandb: Run sweep agent with: wandb agent entity-name/thunder-resnet/fgbkmk3q
```

### Step 2 — Initialize the sweep:

```bash
wandb sweep sweep.yaml
```

### Step 3 — Run agents on Thunder GPU instances:

```bash
wandb agent <entity>/<project>/<sweep_id>
```

Each agent pulls new hyperparameters and launches a run automatically.

---

## Distributed Training (DDP, Lightning, DeepSpeed)

### PyTorch DDP Example

```python
wandb.init(
    project="thunder-ddp",
    group="llama7b-a100x4",
    job_type="training",
)
```

Set run names per rank:

```python
wandb.run.name = f"gpu-{rank}"
```

### PyTorch Lightning Example

```python
from lightning.pytorch import Trainer
from lightning.pytorch.loggers import WandbLogger

wandb_logger = WandbLogger(project="thunder-lightning-demo")

trainer = Trainer(
    logger=wandb_logger,
    accelerator="gpu",
    devices=4,
    strategy="ddp",
    max_epochs=50,
)

trainer.fit(model)
```

Lightning automatically:

- Logs metrics and gradients
- Tracks checkpoints
- Handles multi-GPU logging

---

## Offline Mode (Air‑Gapped or Firewalled Environments)

Thunder instances may have intermittent or restricted internet access.

### Run in offline mode:

```bash
export WANDB_MODE=offline
python train.py
```

### Sync later:

```bash
wandb sync /path/to/wandb/run-folder
```

### Fully disable wandb:

```bash
export WANDB_MODE=disabled
```

---

## Best Practices for Thunder Compute GPU Instances

### Run Management

- Use meaningful run names that include dataset + model + GPU type
- Log all hyperparameters in `wandb.config`
- Track system metrics to diagnose bottlenecks
- Organize multi-GPU runs using `group`
- Reduce logging overhead by batching logs

### Artifacts & Checkpointing

- Use meaningful artifact names (e.g. `llama7b-a100-epoch20`)
- Attach useful metadata (epoch, val metrics, dataset version)
- Log fewer but higher-quality checkpoints
- Always use artifacts for long or expensive runs
- Use `use_artifact(...).download()` to restore weights anywhere
- Use artifacts for datasets and checkpoints

### Experimentation

- Use sweeps for expensive experiments
- Compare runs systematically using the dashboard
- Monitor GPU utilization to optimize batch sizes

---

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

```bash
wandb login --relogin
```

### GPU Metrics Not Showing

- Ensure `nvidia-smi` works inside the environment
- Use GPU-enabled containers (`--gpus all`)
- Call `wandb.init()` early

### Connection Issues

- Verify outbound internet access
- Firewalls must allow connections to `*.wandb.ai`
- Use offline mode if required

### Large File Uploads

- Always use artifacts for multi-GB files
- Compress large checkpoints
- Prune old versions
