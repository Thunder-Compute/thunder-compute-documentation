The console displays connection information for your instances but does not provide a built-in terminal.

### Connect to an Instance

Copy the SSH command from the console and run it in your local terminal:

```bash
ssh user@<instance-ip>
```

For easier access with automatic key management, use the [CLI](/cli/operations/connecting-to-instances) or [VSCode extension](/vscode/operations/connecting-to-instances).

### Port Forwarding

To forward ports when using SSH directly, use the `-L` flag:

```bash
ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 user@<instance-ip>
```

This lets you access web servers, Jupyter notebooks, and other services running on your instance through `localhost`.

## Using Standard SSH

Thunder Compute is compatible with standard SSH tools.

See [SSH on Thunder Compute](/guides/ssh-on-thunder-compute) for advanced SSH configuration.
