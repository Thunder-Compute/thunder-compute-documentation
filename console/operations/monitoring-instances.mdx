Monitor your instances to see their status, configuration, and resource allocation.

### Dashboard View

Log in to the [console](https://console.thundercompute.com) to see all your instances on the dashboard.

Each instance card shows:
- Status

- IP address
- Runtime
- Estimated cost

Click on an instance to see detailed information and management options.

## Benchmarking Notes

When measuring performance in **prototyping mode**, note that hardware-level metrics (temperature, wattage, utilization) may not be accurate due to CUDA-level optimizations. Use application-level metrics like iterations per second for reliable comparisons.

For accurate hardware metrics, use **production mode** instances.
