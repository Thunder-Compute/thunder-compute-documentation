Delete instances you no longer need to stop billing. Make sure to back up any important data before deleting.

<Warning>
  Deleting an instance permanently removes it and all associated data. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

### Delete an Instance

1. Find your instance on the dashboard
2. Click the **Delete** button
3. Confirm the deletion

## Before Deleting

Before deleting an instance, make sure to:

1. **Download important files**: Use the CLI or VSCode extension to save any outputs, models, or data you need
2. **Create a snapshot**: If you want to restore your environment later, [create a snapshot](/console/operations/snapshots) first
3. **Push code to GitHub**: Commit and push any code changes to a remote repository

## Billing

Billing stops immediately when an instance is deleted. You are charged only for the time the instance was running.

Check your usage and billing details in the [console billing settings](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings/billing).
