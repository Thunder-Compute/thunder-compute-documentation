The console does not currently support direct file transfers. Use the [CLI](/cli/operations/file-transfers) or [VSCode extension](/vscode/operations/file-transfers) for file operations.

## Alternative Methods

### Cloud Storage

For large datasets, use cloud storage services and download directly to your instance:

- **Google Drive**: Download using `gdown` or the Google Drive API
- **Dropbox**: Use the Dropbox CLI or API
- **S3-compatible storage**: Use `aws s3 cp` or similar tools (e.g., Cloudflare R2)

### Direct SSH/SCP

If you have SSH access configured, use standard `scp` commands:

```bash
# Upload to instance
scp ./local_file.txt user@<instance-ip>:/home/user/

# Download from instance
scp user@<instance-ip>:/home/user/results.csv ./downloads/
```

## Best Practices

- **Compress large transfers**: Zip files before transferring to reduce time
- **Use cloud storage for big files**: For datasets over a few GB, upload to cloud storage and download directly to your instance
- **Back up important outputs**: Always download critical results before deleting an instance
