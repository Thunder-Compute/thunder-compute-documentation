## Payment Options

There are **two ways to pay** for Thunder Compute:

### Option 1: Save a Payment Method
Save a credit card through our Stripe portal to get $10 in free credit every month. You can manage your payment method anytime by going to [console.thundercompute.com/settings?tab=billing](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings?tab=billing) and clicking "manage billing".

### Option 2: Preload Credit
Add credit directly to your account as an alternative to saving a payment method. This credit never expires and will be used before any saved payment method.

**How credits are used:**
1. Free $10 monthly credit (only if you have a valid card on file)
2. Any preloaded credit you've added
3. Charges to your saved payment method

You can switch between options or use both by saving a payment method later even if you started with preloaded credit.

## Billing Alerts

- **Instance reminders:** We'll email you about any running instances so you're never caught off guard.
- **Threshold charges:** As your usage grows, we'll bill your card at preset checkpoints (which rise over time) to prevent runaway bills.

## Our rates

All compute resources are billed per minute only while your instances run. Storage incurs charges even when instances are stopped. For current rates, see our [pricing page](https://www.thundercompute.com/pricing).

## Credit terms

- **Free monthly credit:** You only get $10/month of free credit if you have a valid card on file.
- **Preloaded credit:** Credit you add to your account does not expire and will be used before charging your saved card.
- **Revocation:** Free credit can be revoked at our discretion. 
- **Account policy:** We have a strict one-account-per-person policy.

## Money-Saving Tips

While Thunder Compute is already the cheapest GPU cloud platform, there are a few strategies we recommend to reduce your bill:

- Turn off instances when you're done.
- Right‑size with `tnr modify` to match your workload.
- Delete instances you no longer need.
- Use snapshots to compress long‑term data.
