## Payment Options

There are **two ways to pay** for Thunder Compute:

### Option 1: Save a Payment Method
Save a credit card through our Stripe portal to get automatically billed for usage. You can manage your payment method anytime by going to [console.thundercompute.com/settings/billing](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings/billing) and clicking "manage billing".

### Option 2: Preload Credit
Add credit directly to your account as an alternative to saving a payment method. This credit never expires and will be used before any saved payment method.

**Order of payment**
1. Any preloaded credit you've added
2. Charges to your saved payment method

You can switch between options or use both by saving a payment method later even if you started with preloaded credit.

## Billing Alerts

- **Instance reminders:** We'll email you about any running instances so you're never caught off guard.
- **Threshold charges:** As your usage grows, we'll bill your card at preset checkpoints (which rise over time) to prevent runaway bills.

## Our rates

All compute resources are billed per minute only while your instances run. Storage incurs charges even when instances are stopped. Rates and promotions are subject to change without notice. For current rates, see our [pricing page](https://www.thundercompute.com/pricing).

## Credit terms

- **Preloaded credit:** Credit you add to your account does not expire and will be used before charging your saved card.
- **Revocation:** Promotional credit can be revoked at our discretion. 
- **Account policy:** We have a strict one-account-per-person policy.

## Money-Saving Tips

While Thunder Compute is already the cheapest GPU cloud platform, there are a few strategies we recommend to reduce your bill:

- Turn off instances when you're done.
- Right‑size with `tnr modify` to match your workload.
- Delete instances you no longer need.
- Use snapshots to compress long‑term data.
