## Payment Options

There are **two ways to pay** for Thunder Compute:

### Option 1: Auto-Pay

Set up auto-pay by saving a credit card in the Stripe customer portal. Open it from [console.thundercompute.com/settings/billing](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings/billing) by clicking "manage billing".

### Option 2: Preload Credit

Add credit directly to your account as an alternative to auto-pay. This credit never expires and will be used before any saved payment method.

**Order of payment**

1. Any preloaded credit you've added
2. Charges to your saved payment method

You can switch between options or use both—set up auto-pay anytime, even if you started with preloaded credit.

## Billing Alerts

- **Instance reminders:** We'll email you about any running instances so you're never caught off guard.
- **Threshold charges:** As your usage grows, we'll bill your card at preset checkpoints (which rise over time) to prevent runaway bills.

## Our rates

All compute resources are billed per minute only while your instances run. Rates and promotions are subject to change without notice. For current rates, see our [pricing page](https://www.thundercompute.com/pricing).

## Credit Terms

- **Preloaded credit** does not expire and will be used before charging your saved card.
- **Promotional credit** can be revoked at our discretion.
- **Refunds:** Credit is non-refundable.

## Money-Saving Tips

While Thunder Compute is already the cheapest GPU cloud platform, there are a few strategies we recommend to reduce your bill:

- Delete instances when you're done with them to stop billing.
- Right‑size new workloads with `tnr create --gpu`, `--vcpus`, and related flags so you only pay for what you use.
