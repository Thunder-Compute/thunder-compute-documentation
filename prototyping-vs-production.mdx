Thunder Compute offers two modes for running instances.

| Feature | Prototyping | Production |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Cost | Lower | Higher |
| Compatibility | Most ML workloads | Full CUDA compatibility |
| GPUs | T4, A100 | A100, A100 XL, H100 |
| Multi-GPU | No | Up to 4 GPUs |
| Graphics (OpenGL, Vulkan) | No | Yes |

## Prototyping Mode

<Note>
  Prototyping mode is currently in beta and exclusively available on Thunder Compute.
</Note>

Prototyping mode applies CUDA-level optimizations to maximize GPU utilization, significantly reducing costs for AI/ML development workflows.

### Supported Software

- **PyTorch**: Fully supported (downgrading from the pre-installed version may cause issues)
- **TensorFlow**
- **JAX**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Model Serving**: ComfyUI, Ollama, VLLM, and others
- **Fine Tuning**: Unsloth and others

### Unsupported Workloads

- Graphics workloads (OpenGL, Vulkan, FFMPEG)
- Custom CUDA kernels (may exhibit unpredictable behavior)
- Hardware-specific profiling tools

<Tip>
  If you encounter issues with an unsupported workload, switch to production mode for full compatibility.
</Tip>

### Configuration Options

| Option | Values |
|--------|--------|
| GPU | T4, A100 |
| vCPUs | 4, 8, 16, 32 |
| RAM | 8GB per vCPU |
| Disk | 100-400 GB |

## Production Mode

Production mode provisions a standard virtual machine with full CUDA compatibility and predictable performance.

### When to Choose Production

- Long-running training jobs
- Multi-GPU workloads (up to 4 GPUs)
- Graphics workloads (OpenGL, Vulkan, FFMPEG)
- Custom CUDA kernels
- Workloads requiring accurate hardware metrics

### Configuration Options

| Option | Values |
|--------|--------|
| GPU | A100, A100 XL, H100 |
| GPU Count | 1, 2, 4 |
| vCPUs | 18 per GPU |
| RAM | 144GB per GPU |
| Disk | 100-1000 GB |

## Switching Between Modes

Use the [modify command](/operations/modifying-instances) to switch between prototyping and production mode on an existing instance. Modify also lets you change GPU type, vCPUs, and RAM. Storage can be expanded but not reduced.
