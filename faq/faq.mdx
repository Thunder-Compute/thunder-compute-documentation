  <Accordion title="How much does Thunder Compute cost to use? Can I even get GPUs?">
  Thunder Compute is often up to 5x cheaper than competitors with better GPU availability. This cost savings comes from the GPU idle time inherent to most workflows. You can leave your Thunder Compute instance running without paying for the idle GPU to develop, run notebooks, and debug without worrying about racking up your cloud bill.
