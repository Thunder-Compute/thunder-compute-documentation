  <Accordion title="What is Thunder Compute?">
Thunder Compute is a cloud platform where AI developers never pay for idle GPUs. Every developer uses a CPU-only cloud instance which has on-demand GPU access using our virtual-GPU-over-TCP technology.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I use Thunder Compute?">
    Use pip to install the "tnr" python package and follow our docs to get started in under a minute.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why should I use Thunder Compute?">
  Set up in 60 seconds, never pay for idle GPUs, and scale to as many GPUs as you need with one command. Developers on Thunder Compute pay 10x less by avoiding idle time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does developing with Thunder Compute compare to serverless GPU platforms?">
  Thunder Compute behaves like an EC2 instance. No config, containers, or code changes required.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How much does Thunder Compute cost to use? Can I even get GPUs?">
  Pay only when GPUs are active, billed to the second. You can leave your Thunder Compute instance running without paying for the idle GPU. This lets you develop, run notebooks, and debug for up to 10x cheaper.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I already have most of my infra on prem or in another cloud, can I use Thunder Compute?">
