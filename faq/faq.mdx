  <Accordion title="What is Thunder Compute?">
Thunder Compute creates software to virtualize GPUs over a network. With a single command we trick your computer into thinking it’s directly attached to any number of cloud GPUs, saving developers hours of setup while allowing us to serve 5x more users with the same hardware.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I use Thunder Compute?">
    Install the "tnr" python package, pay a $10 deposit, and follow our docs to get started in under a minute.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why should I use Thunder Compute?">
  Set up in 60 seconds, never pay for idle GPUs, and scale to as many GPUs as you need with one command. Developers on Thunder Compute pay 10x less by avoiding idle time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does developing with Thunder Compute compare to serverless GPU platforms?">
  Thunder Compute behaves like any Linux environment. No config, containers, or code changes required.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How much does Thunder Compute cost to use? Can I even get GPUs?">
  Pay only when GPUs are active, billed to the second. You can leave your Thunder Compute instance running without paying for the idle GPU. This lets you develop, run notebooks, and debug for up to 10x cheaper.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I already have most of my infra on prem or in another cloud, can I use Thunder Compute?">
  Yes, this is what our enterprise solutions are built for! Contact us at [support@thundercompute.com](mailto:support@thundercompute.com) to discuss your specific needs.
