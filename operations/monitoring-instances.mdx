Monitor your instances to see their status, configuration, and resource allocation.

  <Tab title="CLI">
    ### View Instance Status

    List all your instances with their details:

    ```bash
    tnr status
    ```

    This displays:
    - **Instance ID**: The identifier used for other commands (e.g., `0`)
    - **Status**: `RUNNING`, `CREATING`, `RESTORING`, etc.
    - **IP Address**: The public IP for SSH access
    - **GPU Type**: T4, A100, A100 XL, or H100
    - **GPU Count**: Number of GPUs (production only)
    - **vCPU Count**: Number of virtual CPUs
    - **RAM**: Total memory
    - **Disk Size**: Storage capacity
    - **Template**: The template or snapshot used

    ### Disable Auto-Refresh

    By default, `tnr status` monitors for status changes. Use the `--no-wait` flag to get a single snapshot:

    ```bash
    tnr status --no-wait
    ```

    ### View Instances

    Open the Thunder Compute sidebar panel to see all your instances. Each instance shows:

    - Status indicator (running, creating, etc.)
    - GPU type and count
    - Instance ID

    {/* TODO: Add screenshot of instance list in VSCode sidebar */}

    Click on an instance to see more details or connect to it.

    ### Refresh Status

    Click the refresh button at the top of the panel to update the instance list.

    {/* TODO: Add screenshot of refresh button */}

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Console">
    ### Dashboard View

    Log in to the [console](https://console.thundercompute.com) to see all your instances on the dashboard.

    {/* TODO: Add screenshot of console dashboard */}

    Each instance card shows:
    - Status
    - GPU configuration
    - IP address
    - Runtime
    - Estimated cost

    Click on an instance to see detailed information and management options.

## Instance States

| Status      | Description                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `RUNNING`   | Instance is active and ready to use              |
| `CREATING`  | Instance is being provisioned                    |
| `RESTORING` | Instance is being restored from a snapshot       |
| `DELETING`  | Instance is being removed                        |

## Benchmarking Notes

When measuring performance in **prototyping mode**, note that hardware-level metrics (temperature, wattage, utilization) may not be accurate due to CUDA-level optimizations. Use application-level metrics like iterations per second for reliable comparisons.

For accurate hardware metrics, use **production mode** instances.
