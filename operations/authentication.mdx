Before using Thunder Compute, you need to authenticate your account. This page covers how to log in and manage API tokens across the CLI, VSCode extension, and console.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    ### Log In

    Run the following command to authenticate the CLI:

    ```bash
    tnr login
    ```

    This opens a link to the [console](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings?tab=tokens) where you can generate an API token. Paste the token back into your terminal to complete authentication.

    Under the hood, this saves your token to `~/.thunder/token`.

    ### Log Out

    To remove your stored credentials:

    ```bash
    tnr logout
    ```

    This deletes the token file from your machine.

    ### Programmatic Authentication

    For scripts and automation, you can authenticate without the interactive flow:

    1. **Token file**: Save your API token to `~/.thunder/token`
    2. **Environment variable**: Set `TNR_API_TOKEN` in your shell

    ```bash
    export TNR_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
    ```

  </Tab>

    ### Log In

    The extension may prompt you to log in automatically when you first install it.

    If not, open the command palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) and run:

    ```
    Thunder Compute: Login
    ```

    Follow the prompts to navigate to the [console](https://console.thundercompute.com/signup) and generate a login token.

    ### Log Out

    Open the command palette and run:

    ```
    Thunder Compute: Logout
    ```

    {/* TODO: Add screenshot of logout command in VSCode */}

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Console">
    The [console](https://console.thundercompute.com) uses browser-based authentication. Sign up or log in with your email to access your account.

  </Tab>

## Managing API Tokens

API tokens authenticate your CLI and extension access. You can manage them in the [console](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings?tab=tokens).

- **Generate tokens**: Create new tokens for each device or use case
- **Revoke tokens**: Remove access for specific tokens without affecting others
- **Token persistence**: Tokens never expire unless manually revoked

<Note>
  Use unique tokens for each device so you can revoke access individually if needed.
</Note>

## Adding a Payment Method

Before creating instances, you need a payment method on file. Visit the [billing settings](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings/billing) to add a credit card.
