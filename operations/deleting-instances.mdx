Delete instances you no longer need to stop billing. Make sure to back up any important data before deleting.

<Warning>
  Deleting an instance permanently removes it and all associated data. This action cannot be undone.

    ### Interactive Delete

    Run the delete command to see a list of your instances:

    ```bash
    tnr delete
    ```

    Select an instance and confirm the deletion.

    ### Direct Delete

    Delete an instance directly by ID:

    ```bash
    tnr delete 0
    ```

    This skips the interactive menu but still requires confirmation.

## Before Deleting

Before deleting an instance, make sure to:

1. **Download important files**: Use `tnr scp` or the VSCode file explorer to save any outputs, models, or data you need
2. **Create a snapshot**: If you want to restore your environment later, [create a snapshot](/operations/snapshots) first
3. **Push code to GitHub**: Commit and push any code changes to a remote repository

<Note>
  Instance storage is ephemeral. Once deleted, all data on the instance is permanently lost. See [Using Ephemeral Storage](/guides/using-ephemeral-storage) for recommended backup workflows.
</Note>

## Billing

Billing stops immediately when an instance is deleted. You are charged only for the time the instance was running.

Check your usage and billing details in the [console billing settings](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings/billing).
