Transfer files between your local machine and Thunder Compute instances. You can upload files to an instance or download files from it.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    Use the `scp` command to transfer files:

    ```bash
    tnr scp <source_path> <destination_path>
    ```

    ### Path Format

    - **Remote paths**: `instance_id:path` (e.g., `0:/home/user/data`)
    - **Local paths**: Standard paths (e.g., `./data` or `/home/user/file.txt`)

    Each transfer must include exactly one remote path and one local path.

    ### Upload to Instance

    ```bash
    tnr scp ./local_file.txt 0:/home/user/
    ```

    ### Download from Instance

    ```bash
    tnr scp 0:/home/user/results.csv ./downloads/
    ```

    ### Transfer Directories

    To transfer entire directories, use the recursive flag:

    ```bash
    # Upload a directory
    tnr scp -r ./my_project 0:/home/user/

    # Download a directory
    tnr scp -r 0:/home/user/outputs ./local_outputs/
    ```

    <Note>
      File transfers have a 60-second connection timeout. SSH key setup, compression, and `~/` expansion are handled automatically.

  <Tab title="VSCode / Cursor / Windsurf">
    When connected to an instance via the Remote-SSH extension, you can transfer files using the built-in file explorer.

    ### Upload Files

    1. Connect to your instance using the Connect button
    2. In the new window, open the file explorer (sidebar)
    3. Drag and drop files from your local machine into the explorer

    ### Download Files

    1. Right-click on a file in the remote file explorer
    2. Select **Download** to save it locally

    {/* TODO: Add screenshot of download context menu */}

    ### Alternative: Integrated Terminal

    You can also use `scp` directly in the integrated terminal if you have the CLI installed locally.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Console">
    The console does not currently support direct file transfers. Use the CLI or VSCode extension for file operations.

    For large datasets, consider using cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or S3-compatible storage (e.g., Cloudflare R2) and downloading directly to your instance.

## Best Practices

- **Compress large transfers**: Zip files before transferring to reduce time
- **Use cloud storage for big files**: For datasets over a few GB, upload to cloud storage and download directly to your instance
- **Back up important outputs**: Always download critical results before deleting an instance

<Note>
  Instance storage is ephemeral. Back up important data externally before deleting an instance. See [Using Ephemeral Storage](/guides/using-ephemeral-storage) for recommended workflows.
