Connect to your running instances via SSH. Thunder Compute handles key management automatically, so you can connect with a single command.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    ### Interactive Connection

    Run the connect command to see a list of your instances:

    ```bash
    tnr connect
    ```

    Select an instance from the menu to connect.

    ### Direct Connection

    Connect directly using the instance ID:

    ```bash
    tnr connect 0
    ```

    Use `tnr status` to see instance IDs. The default ID is `0`.

    ### Port Forwarding

    Forward ports from your instance to your local machine with the `-t` or `--tunnel` flag:

    ```bash
    tnr connect 0 -t 8000
    ```

    Forward multiple ports by repeating the flag:

    ```bash
    tnr connect 0 -t 8000 -t 8080 -t 3000
    ```

    This lets you access web servers, Jupyter notebooks, and other services running on your instance through `localhost`.

    **Example**: If you run a Jupyter notebook on port 8888:

    ```bash
    tnr connect 0 -t 8888
    ```

    Then open `http://localhost:8888` in your browser.

  </Tab>

    ### Connect to an Instance

    1. Open the Thunder Compute sidebar panel
    2. Find your running instance in the list
    3. Click the **Connect** button (the icon with two arrows pointing toward each other)

    {/* TODO: Add screenshot of connect button in VSCode sidebar */}

    A new VSCode window opens connected to your instance. You can browse files, edit code, and run terminals as if working locally.

    {/* TODO: Add screenshot of connected VSCode window */}

    <Note>
      If connecting fails, make sure you have the [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension installed.
    </Note>

    ### Port Forwarding

    Once connected, VSCode automatically detects services running on common ports and offers to forward them.

    To manually forward a port:

    1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P` / `Cmd + Shift + P`)
    2. Run **Remote-SSH: Forward Port**
    3. Enter the port number

    Or use the **Ports** panel in the bottom bar to manage forwarded ports.

    {/* TODO: Add screenshot of ports panel in VSCode */}

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Console">
    The console displays connection information for your instances but does not provide a built-in terminal.

    To connect, copy the SSH command from the console and run it in your local terminal:

    {/* TODO: Add screenshot of SSH command in console */}

    ```bash
    ssh user@<instance-ip>
    ```

    For easier access, use the CLI or VSCode extension which handle key management automatically.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using Standard SSH

If you prefer using your own SSH client, Thunder Compute is compatible with standard SSH tools. The CLI configures your `~/.ssh/config` automatically when you first connect.

See [SSH on Thunder Compute](/guides/ssh-on-thunder-compute) for advanced SSH configuration.
