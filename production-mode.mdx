Production mode provisions a standard virtual machine (VM) on Thunder Compute with all low-level execution optimizations disabled. While this results in a higher hourly cost than the Prototyping tier, it guarantees maximum compatibility, predictable performance, and uninterrupted runtime.

## When to choose Production mode

- Long-running training jobs
- High-availability inference services
- Multi-GPU workloads
- Workloads that rely on graphics, custom kernels, or other components that are incompatible with the Prototyping tier

## Mode-Specific Configuration

Production mode uses the same [infrastructure specifications](/docs/technical-specs#instance-infrastructure) as Prototyping mode, but with all low-level optimizations disabled for maximum compatibility.

<Note>
  For detailed hardware specifications, networking, and pre-installed software, see the [Technical Specifications](/docs/technical-specs) documentation.

## Production Mode Benefits

- **Full compatibility**: All CUDA operations and libraries work as expected
- **Predictable performance**: No performance variability from optimizations
- **Hardware metrics**: Accurate temperature, wattage, and utilization reporting
- **Graphics support**: Full support for OpenGL, Vulkan, and FFMPEG

## Switching between tiers

Instances cannot be switched between tiers after creation. To move a workload to production mode, back up your data, create a new instance in production mode, and restore your environment on the new instance. When the migration is complete, delete the original instance to avoid additional charges.
