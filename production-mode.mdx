Production mode provisions a standard virtual machine (VM) on Thunder Compute with all low-level execution optimizations disabled. While this results in a higher hourly cost than the Prototyping tier, it guarantees maximum compatibility, predictable performance, and uninterrupted runtime.

## When to choose Production mode

- Long-running training jobs
- High-availability inference services
- Multi-GPU workloads
- Workloads that rely on graphics, custom kernels, or other components that are incompatible with the Prototyping tier

## Resources

Each Production instance is allocated **24 vCPUs** and **220 GiB RAM** per attached GPU. Currently, we offer A100 80GB GPUs in production mode.

## Switching between tiers

1. Stop the instance.
2. Select the desired tier in the CLI (`thunder instance modify --mode production`), the web console, or the VS Code extension.
3. Start the instance.

The operation takes a few seconds and does not affect data stored on attached volumes. You can switch back at any time.
