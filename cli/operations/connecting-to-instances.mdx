Connect to your running instances via SSH. Thunder Compute handles key management automatically, so you can connect with a single command.

### Interactive Connection

Run the connect command to see a list of your instances:

```bash
tnr connect
```

Select an instance from the menu to connect.

### Direct Connection

Connect directly using the instance ID:

```bash
tnr connect 0
```

Use `tnr status` to see instance IDs. The default ID is `0`.

### Port Forwarding

Forward ports from your instance to your local machine with the `-t` or `--tunnel` flag:

```bash
tnr connect 0 -t 8000
```

Forward multiple ports by repeating the flag:

```bash
tnr connect 0 -t 8000 -t 8080 -t 3000
```

This lets you access web servers, Jupyter notebooks, and other services running on your instance through `localhost`.

**Example**: If you run a Jupyter notebook on port 8888:

```bash
tnr connect 0 -t 8888
```

Then open `http://localhost:8888` in your browser.

## Using Standard SSH

If you prefer using your own SSH client, Thunder Compute is compatible with standard SSH tools. The CLI configures your `~/.ssh/config` automatically when you first connect.

See [SSH on Thunder Compute](/guides/ssh-on-thunder-compute) for advanced SSH configuration.
