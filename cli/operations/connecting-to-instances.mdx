Connect to your running instances via SSH. Thunder Compute handles key management automatically, so you can connect with a single command.

### Interactive Connection

Run the connect command to see a list of your instances:

```bash
tnr connect
```

Select an instance from the menu to connect.

### Direct Connection

Connect directly using the instance ID:

```bash
tnr connect 0
```

Use `tnr status` to see instance IDs. The default ID is `0`.

### Exposing Services

To expose web servers, Jupyter notebooks, or other services running on your instance, use a [Cloudflare Tunnel](/technical-specs#port-access).

## Using Standard SSH

If you prefer using your own SSH client, Thunder Compute is compatible with standard SSH tools. The CLI configures your `~/.ssh/config` automatically when you first connect.

See [SSH on Thunder Compute](/guides/ssh-on-thunder-compute) for advanced SSH configuration.
