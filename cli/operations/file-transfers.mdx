Transfer files between your local machine and Thunder Compute instances. You can upload files to an instance or download files from it.

Use the `scp` command to transfer files:

```bash
tnr scp <source_path> <destination_path>
```

### Path Format

- **Remote paths**: `instance_id:path` (e.g., `0:/home/user/data`)
- **Local paths**: Standard paths (e.g., `./data` or `/home/user/file.txt`)

Each transfer must include exactly one remote path and one local path.

### Upload to Instance

```bash
tnr scp ./local_file.txt 0:/home/user/
```

### Download from Instance

```bash
tnr scp 0:/home/user/results.csv ./downloads/
```

### Transfer Directories

To transfer entire directories, use the recursive flag:

```bash
# Upload a directory
tnr scp -r ./my_project 0:/home/user/

# Download a directory
tnr scp -r 0:/home/user/outputs ./local_outputs/
```

<Note>
  File transfers have a 60-second connection timeout. SSH key setup, compression, and `~/` expansion are handled automatically.
</Note>

## Best Practices

- **Compress large transfers**: Zip files before transferring to reduce time
- **Use cloud storage for big files**: For datasets over a few GB, upload to cloud storage and download directly to your instance
- **Back up important outputs**: Always download critical results before deleting an instance
