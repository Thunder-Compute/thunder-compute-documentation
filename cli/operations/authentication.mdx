Before using Thunder Compute, you need to authenticate your account.

### Log In

Run the following command to authenticate the CLI:

```bash
tnr login
```

Your browser will open automatically to complete authentication via OAuth.

To use a token instead, press `T` during login to enter a token generated from the [console](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings?tab=tokens).

### Log Out

To remove your stored credentials:

```bash
tnr logout
```

This deletes the token file from your machine.

### Programmatic Authentication

For scripts and automation, set the `TNR_API_TOKEN` environment variable:

```bash
export TNR_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

## Managing API Tokens

API tokens authenticate your CLI and extension access. You can manage them in the [console](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings?tab=tokens).

- **Generate tokens**: Create new tokens for each device or use case
- **Revoke tokens**: Remove access for specific tokens without affecting others
- **Token persistence**: Tokens never expire unless manually revoked

<Note>
  Use unique tokens for each device so you can revoke access individually if needed.
</Note>

## Adding a Payment Method

Before creating instances, you need a payment method on file. Visit the [billing settings](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings/billing) to add a credit card.
