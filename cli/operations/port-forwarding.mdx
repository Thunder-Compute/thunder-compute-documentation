Expose web servers and APIs running on your Thunder Compute instance to the internet. Your service becomes accessible at a public URL with automatic HTTPS and DDoS protection.

<Note>
  Port forwarding is currently only available through the CLI. Support for VS Code and Console is coming soon.
</Note>

## How It Works

When you forward a port, your HTTP service becomes available at:

```
https://<instance-uuid>-<port>.thundercompute.net
```

For example, if your instance UUID is `abc123` and you forward port `8080`, your service is accessible at:

```
https://abc123-8080.thundercompute.net
```

All traffic is automatically secured with HTTPS and protected against DDoS attacks—no configuration needed.

<Warning>
  Only HTTP-based services are supported (including gRPC). Other protocols like raw TCP or UDP are not currently supported.
</Warning>

## Forward Ports

### Interactive Mode

Run the command without arguments to use the interactive interface:

```bash
tnr ports forward
```

This guides you through selecting an instance and entering the ports you want to forward.

### Using Flags

Add or remove ports directly with flags:

```bash
# Forward a single port
tnr ports forward <instance_id> --add 8080

# Forward multiple ports
tnr ports forward <instance_id> --add 8080,3000,5000

# Remove a forwarded port
tnr ports forward <instance_id> --remove 8080

# Add and remove in one command
tnr ports forward <instance_id> --add 3000 --remove 8080
```

## List Forwarded Ports

See all forwarded ports across your instances:

```bash
tnr ports list
```

## Limitations

- **Port 22 is reserved** for SSH and cannot be forwarded
- **Valid port range**: 1-65535
- **HTTP only**: Your service must speak HTTP or gRPC

## Example: Exposing a Web Server

1. Start a web server on your instance (e.g., on port 8080)
2. Forward the port:
   ```bash
   tnr ports forward <instance_id> --add 8080
   ```
3. Access your service at `https://<instance-uuid>-8080.thundercompute.net`
