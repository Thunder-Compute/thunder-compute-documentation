Monitor your instances to see their status, configuration, and resource allocation.

### View Instance Status

List all your instances with their details:

```bash
tnr status
```

This displays:
- **Instance ID**: The identifier used for other commands (e.g., `0`)
- **Status**: `RUNNING`, `CREATING`, `RESTORING`, etc.
- **IP Address**: The public IP for SSH access
- **GPU Type**: A6000, A100, or H100
- **GPU Count**: Number of GPUs (production only)
- **vCPU Count**: Number of virtual CPUs
- **RAM**: Total memory
- **Disk Size**: Storage capacity
- **Template**: The template or snapshot used

### Disable Auto-Refresh

By default, `tnr status` monitors for status changes. Use the `--no-wait` flag to get a single snapshot:

```bash
tnr status --no-wait
```

## Instance States

| Status      | Description                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `RUNNING`   | Instance is active and ready to use              |
| `CREATING`  | Instance is being provisioned                    |
| `RESTORING` | Instance is being restored from a snapshot       |
| `DELETING`  | Instance is being removed                        |

## Benchmarking Notes

When measuring performance in **prototyping mode**, note that hardware-level metrics (temperature, wattage, utilization) may not be accurate due to CUDA-level optimizations. Use application-level metrics like iterations per second for reliable comparisons.

For accurate hardware metrics, use **production mode** instances.
