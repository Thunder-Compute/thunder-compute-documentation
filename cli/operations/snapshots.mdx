Snapshots capture the full disk state of a running instance, letting you restore your environment later without reinstalling dependencies or re-downloading models. You can also use snapshots to change instance specifications by restoring to a new instance with different GPU or CPU settings.

<Note>
  Snapshots are currently in beta. Share feedback on [Discord](https://discord.gg/nwuETS9jJK) or email support@thundercompute.com.
</Note>

## Why Use Snapshots?

- **Save your environment**: Capture installed packages, models, and configurations
- **Faster setup**: Spin up new instances from a known-good state
- **Change specs**: Create a new instance with different GPU/CPU while keeping your data

### Create a Snapshot

Use the interactive menu:

```bash
tnr snapshot create
```

Or specify the instance and name directly:

```bash
tnr snapshot create --instance-id 0 --name my-environment
```

<Note>
  Snapshots can only be created from instances in `RUNNING` state.
</Note>

### List Snapshots

View all your snapshots with their status, size, and creation date:

```bash
tnr snapshot list
```

Status values:
- **READY**: Snapshot is complete and can be used
- **CREATING**: Snapshot is still being created
- **FAILED**: Snapshot creation failed

### Delete a Snapshot

Remove snapshots you no longer need:

```bash
# Interactive selection
tnr snapshot delete

# Delete by name
tnr snapshot delete my-environment
```

<Warning>
  Deleting a snapshot is permanent and cannot be undone.
</Warning>

### Restore from a Snapshot

When creating a new instance, your snapshots appear alongside templates:

```bash
tnr create
# Select your snapshot in the "Templates" step
```

The new instance's disk size must be at least as large as the snapshot. The CLI enforces this automatically.

<Note>
  Restoring from a snapshot takes about 10 minutes per 100GB of data. The instance shows as `RESTORING` during this time.
</Note>

## Best Practices

1. **Name snapshots descriptively**: Include the project, date, or purpose (e.g., `llama-finetuned-jan2026`)

2. **Snapshot before major changes**: Create a snapshot before installing new packages or modifying your environment

3. **Clean up unused snapshots**: Snapshots count toward your storage. Delete old ones you no longer need

4. **Keep snapshots small**: Remove large temporary files before creating a snapshot to speed up creation and restoration

## Snapshots vs External Backups

Snapshots are great for quickly restoring your environment, but they're tied to Thunder Compute. For long-term data preservation, also use:

- **GitHub** for code and configuration
- **Local downloads** for important outputs
- **Cloud storage** (R2, Google Drive) for large files
