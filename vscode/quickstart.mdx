### Installation

- [Cursor extension](cursor:extension/ThunderCompute.thunder-compute)
- [Windsurf extension](windsurf:extension/ThunderCompute.thunder-compute)

You must have the editor installed for these links to work.

### Authentication

You may be automatically prompted to login. If not, open the command palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) and run `Thunder Compute: Login`.

Your browser will open automatically to complete authentication.

### Add a Payment Method

Click on the `Connect` button next to your instance, shaped like two arrows pointing towards each other.

<Note>
  If connecting to the instance fails, check that you have the remote-ssh extension installed on your editor.
</Note>

A new window will open connected to your instance. You can drag files you need into the file explorer, run notebooks, scripts, and more as if they were on your local machine.
