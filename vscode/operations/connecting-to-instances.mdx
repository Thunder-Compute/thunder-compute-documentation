Connect to your running instances via SSH. Thunder Compute handles key management automatically.

### Connect to an Instance

1. Open the Thunder Compute sidebar panel
2. Find your running instance in the list
3. Click the **Connect** button (the icon with two arrows pointing toward each other)

A new VSCode window opens connected to your instance. You can browse files, edit code, and run terminals as if working locally.

<Note>
  If connecting fails, make sure you have the [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension installed.
</Note>

### Exposing Services

To expose web servers, Jupyter notebooks, or other services running on your instance, use a [Cloudflare Tunnel](/technical-specs#port-access).

## Using Standard SSH

If you prefer using your own SSH client, Thunder Compute is compatible with standard SSH tools.

See [SSH on Thunder Compute](/guides/ssh-on-thunder-compute) for advanced SSH configuration.
