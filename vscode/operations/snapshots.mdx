Snapshots capture the full disk state of a running instance, letting you restore your environment later without reinstalling dependencies or re-downloading models. You can also use snapshots to change instance specifications by restoring to a new instance with different GPU or CPU settings.

<Note>
  Snapshots are currently in beta. Share feedback on [Discord](https://discord.gg/nwuETS9jJK) or email support@thundercompute.com.

## Why Use Snapshots?

- **Save your environment**: Capture installed packages, models, and configurations
- **Faster setup**: Spin up new instances from a known-good state
- **Change specs**: Create a new instance with different GPU/CPU while keeping your data

### Create a Snapshot

1. Open the Thunder Compute sidebar panel
2. Find your running instance
3. Click the snapshot icon (camera) next to the instance
4. Enter a name for your snapshot

### View Snapshots

Your snapshots appear in the Thunder Compute panel below your instances.

### Restore from a Snapshot

When creating a new instance, select your snapshot from the template dropdown instead of a base template.

### Delete a Snapshot

Right-click on a snapshot in the panel and select **Delete**.

## Best Practices

1. **Name snapshots descriptively**: Include the project, date, or purpose (e.g., `llama-finetuned-jan2026`)

2. **Snapshot before major changes**: Create a snapshot before installing new packages or modifying your environment

3. **Clean up unused snapshots**: Snapshots count toward your storage. Delete old ones you no longer need

4. **Keep snapshots small**: Remove large temporary files before creating a snapshot to speed up creation and restoration

## Snapshots vs External Backups

Snapshots are great for quickly restoring your environment, but they're tied to Thunder Compute. For long-term data preservation, also use:

- **GitHub** for code and configuration
- **Local downloads** for important outputs
- **Cloud storage** (R2, Google Drive) for large files
