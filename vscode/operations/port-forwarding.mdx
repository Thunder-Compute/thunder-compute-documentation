Public port forwarding with automatic HTTPS and DDoS protection is currently only available through the [CLI](/cli/operations/port-forwarding).

For local port forwarding while developing, you can use VS Code's built-in [port forwarding feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/port-forwarding) when connected to your instance.
