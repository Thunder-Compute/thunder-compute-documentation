Before using Thunder Compute, you need to authenticate your account.

### Log In

The extension may prompt you to log in automatically when you first install it.

If not, open the command palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) and run:

```
Thunder Compute: Login
```

Follow the prompts to navigate to the [console](https://console.thundercompute.com/signup) and generate a login token.

### Log Out

Open the command palette and run:

```
Thunder Compute: Logout
```

## Managing API Tokens

API tokens authenticate your CLI and extension access. You can manage them in the [console](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings?tab=tokens).

- **Generate tokens**: Create new tokens for each device or use case
- **Revoke tokens**: Remove access for specific tokens without affecting others
- **Token persistence**: Tokens never expire unless manually revoked

<Note>
  Use unique tokens for each device so you can revoke access individually if needed.
</Note>

## Adding a Payment Method

Before creating instances, you need a payment method on file. Visit the [billing settings](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings/billing) to add a credit card.
