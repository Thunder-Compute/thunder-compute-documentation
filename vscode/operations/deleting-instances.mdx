Delete instances you no longer need to stop billing. Make sure to back up any important data before deleting.

<Warning>
  Deleting an instance permanently removes it and all associated data. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

### Delete an Instance

1. Open the Thunder Compute sidebar panel
2. Find the instance you want to delete
3. Click the delete button (trash icon) next to the instance
4. Confirm the deletion in the dialog

## Before Deleting

Before deleting an instance, make sure to:

1. **Download important files**: Use the VSCode file explorer to save any outputs, models, or data you need
2. **Create a snapshot**: If you want to restore your environment later, [create a snapshot](/vscode/operations/snapshots) first
3. **Push code to GitHub**: Commit and push any code changes to a remote repository

## Billing

Billing stops immediately when an instance is deleted. You are charged only for the time the instance was running.

Check your usage and billing details in the [console billing settings](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings/billing).
