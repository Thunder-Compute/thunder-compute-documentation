Monitor your instances to see their status, configuration, and resource allocation.

### View Instances

Open the Thunder Compute sidebar panel to see all your instances. Each instance shows:

- Status indicator (running, creating, etc.)
- GPU type and count
- Instance ID

Click on an instance to see more details or connect to it.

### Refresh Status

Click the refresh button at the top of the panel to update the instance list.

## Instance States

| Status      | Description                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `RUNNING`   | Instance is active and ready to use              |
| `CREATING`  | Instance is being provisioned                    |
| `RESTORING` | Instance is being restored from a snapshot       |
| `DELETING`  | Instance is being removed                        |

## Benchmarking Notes

When measuring performance in **prototyping mode**, note that hardware-level metrics (temperature, wattage, utilization) may not be accurate due to CUDA-level optimizations. Use application-level metrics like iterations per second for reliable comparisons.

For accurate hardware metrics, use **production mode** instances.
