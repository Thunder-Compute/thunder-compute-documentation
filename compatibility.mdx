## Use cases

Thunder Compute is optimized for AI/ML development workflows. That said, Thunder Compute has the full functionality of an EC2-style on-demand GPU cloud instance.

## CUDA versioning

- CUDA version 12.0 or greater
- CUDNN version 9.0 or greater

<Warning>
  Do not attempt to reinstall CUDA. If it seems like you need an older CUDA driver, you almost always are better off upgrading your other dependencies (e.g., PyTorch)
</Warning>

## Officially supported libraries

The following libraries and tools are thoroughly tested:

- PyTorch
- Notebooks
- AI model serving tools like ComfyUI, Ollama, VLLM, Unsloth, and more

Note: make sure you install the cuda-compatible version of these libraries. The cuda-compatible PyTorch binary and latest CUDA drivers are pre-installed on every Thunder Compute instance.

## Pre-installed libraries

- CUDA toolkit
- Docker (see [Docker on Thunder Compute](/guides/using-docker-on-thundercompute))
- PyTorch (and derivatives), Numpy, Pandas
- Jupyterlab

## Technical specs

- Egress/Ingress: 7Gbps
- IP: dynamic
- Location: U.S. (region varies)
- E series CPU instances in Azure

## Experimental (less stable)

The following workloads are less tested, experimental, or unstable:

- Tensorflow [experimental]
- PyTorch Lightning [experimental]
- Jax [experimental]
- Custom CUDA Kernels [unpredictable behavior, particularly with errors and profiling. Message us for details]

<Note>
  If you encounter compatibility issues with these experimental workloads, consider switching to [Production mode](/docs/production-mode) for maximum compatibility and predictable performance.
</Note>

## Unsupported

Currently, Thunder Compute lacks official support for graphics workloads such as OpenGL, Vulkan, and FFMPEG. If you'd like to run these, contact us.

<Tip>
  For workloads requiring graphics support, custom kernels, or components incompatible with the prototyping tier, use [Production mode](/docs/production-mode) which provides maximum stability and reliability with all optimizations disabled.
</Tip>

## Cryptocurrency mining

Mining, staking, or otherwise interacting with cryptocurrency is strictly prohibited on Thunder Compute. If cryptocurrency-related activity is detected, the associated account is immediately banned from Thunder Compute and any billing credit is revoked. The account is then billed for the full amount of usage.
