## Use cases

Thunder Compute is optimized for AI/ML development workflows. That said, Thunder Compute has the full functionality of an EC2-style on-demand GPU cloud instance.

## CUDA versioning

- CUDA version 12.1 or greater
- CUDNN version 9.0 or greater

<Warning>
  Do not attempt to reinstall CUDA. If it seems like you need an older CUDA driver, you almost always are better off upgrading your other dependencies (e.g., PyTorch)
</Warning>

## Officially supported libraries

The following libraries and tools are thoroughly tested:

- PyTorch
- Notebooks
- AI model serving tools like ComfyUI, Ollama, VLLM, Unsloth, and more

Note: make sure you install the cuda-compatible version of these libraries. The cuda-compatible PyTorch binary and latest CUDA drivers are pre-installed on every Thunder Compute instance.

## Pre-installed libraries

- CUDA toolkit
- Docker (see [Docker on Thunder Compute](/guides/using-docker-on-thundercompute))
- PyTorch (and derivatives), Numpy, Pandas
- Jupyterlab

## Technical specs

- Egress/Ingress: 7Gbps
- IP: dynamic
- Region: U.S. Central (Iowa)
- E or N series CPU instances in GCP

## Experimental (less stable)

The following workloads are less tested, experimental, or unstable:

- Tensorflow [experimental]
- PyTorch Lightning [experimental]
- Jax [experimental]
- Custom CUDA Kernels [unpredictable behavior, particularly with errors and profiling. Message us for details]

## Unsupported

Currently, Thunder Compute lacks official support for graphics workloads such as OpenGL, Vulkan, and FFMPEG. If you'd like to run these, contact us.

## Cryptocurrency mining

Mining, staking, or otherwise interacting with cryptocurrency is strictly prohibited on Thunder Compute. If cryptocurrency-related activity is detected, the associated account is immediately banned from Thunder Compute and any billing credit is revoked. The account is then billed for the full amount of usage.

## Miscellaneous tips

We use a new kind of virtualization to maximize GPU utilization, reducing your cost. To learn more about how this works, check out this [blog post](https://www.thundercompute.com/blog/how-thunder-compute-works-gpu-over-tcp).

If you encounter any strange issues or errors, please check our [troubleshooting guide](/docs/troubleshooting) or contact us.
