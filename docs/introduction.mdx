Most cloud GPUs sit idle 80-85% of the time, meaning you're paying for GPUs even when you're not using them.

We've built network-attached GPU technology that lets multiple servers share a single pool of GPUs. This means:

*   **Cost savings:** You only pay when your code is actively running on the GPU
*   **Zero configuration:** You get the same experience as having a local GPU
*   **Flexibility:** You can instantly add, remove, or switch GPU types with one command

Think of it like having an unlimited supply of any GPU you need, available instantly, while only paying for the seconds you actually use them.

Thunder Compute is the best option for use cases where GPUs are often idle, such as developing AI/ML or hosting an inference server.
