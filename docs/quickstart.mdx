## Getting Started

<Note>
  **Alternative Installation**: If you prefer using VSCode instead of the CLI,
  you can install our VSCode extension. See our [VSCode integration
  guide](/guides/vscode-integration-for-thunder-compute) for detailed
  instructions.
</Note>

### Install Thunder Compute

You can install Thunder Compute using either our standalone installers or the pip package, depending on your operating system.

#### Option 1: Standalone Installers (Recommended where available)

**Linux**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://console.thundercompute.com/install.sh | sh
```

This script will download and install the latest version of Thunder Compute CLI for Linux. The installer will:

- Verify system compatibility
- Install the binary to `/usr/local/bin/tnr` (may require sudo permissions)
- Set appropriate file permissions
- Verify the installation

**Windows**

1. Download the Windows installer (.exe) from [our downloads page](https://console.thundercompute.com/download)
2. Run the installer and follow the installation steps
3. After installation, you can run the commands in PowerShell

#### Option 2: Python Package (pip)

If you prefer using pip or need to install in a Python environment:

**macOS** (currently only supports pip installation)

```bash
pip install tnr
```

We're currently using the Python package for macOS. Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

**Linux and Windows** (alternative method)

```bash
pip install tnr
```

**Requirements**:

- Python 3.7 or later
- pip package manager

<Note>
  **Windows Users**: If you encounter permissions issues, check our
  [troubleshooting guide](/docs/troubleshooting) for common solutions.
</Note>

### Authenticate the CLI

```bash
tnr login
```

After running this command, navigate to the console to [generate a token](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings/tokens).

### Add a payment method

Visit the console to [add a payment method](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings/billing) to your account.

### Using Thunder Compute

```bash
# Create an instance
tnr create

# Check on your instance
tnr status

# Connect to a running instance
tnr connect 0
```

For more advanced instance configuration options, check our [CLI reference guide](/docs/cli-reference).

That's it! You're now ready to use Thunder Compute.
