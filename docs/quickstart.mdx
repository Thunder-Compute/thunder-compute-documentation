    If you're looking to quickly test out a model with a tool like ComfyUI, Ollama Open WebUI, or Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge, running a template in-browser is the fastest way to get your tool up and running.

    You can start by testing out a model in your browser and later connect to the instance with our CLI or VSCode for deeper customization.
