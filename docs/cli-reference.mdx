# Thunder Compute CLI Reference

Thunder Compute provides managed instances that are optimized for performance. The Thunder Compute CLI contains all of the functionality you need to create, edit, use, and delete these instances.

## Installation

Install the Thunder Compute CLI (tnr) on your local machine to manage Thunder Compute instances.

## Instance Management

### Create an Instance

Create a new Thunder Compute instance:

```bash
tnr create
```

This creates a new instance and automatically assigns an instance ID.

#### CPU Configuration

For custom vCPU configuration (not recommended for most use cases):

```bash
tnr create --vcpus <vcpu_count>
```

Note: We highly recommend using the default 4 vCPU configuration. Additional vCPUs are billed proportionally. RAM scales according to vCPU count (4GB per vCPU).

#### GPU Configuration

Specify a GPU type when creating an instance:

```bash
tnr create --gpu <gpu_type>
```

Available GPU types:
- `t4` (default): NVIDIA T4 (16GB VRAM) - Best for most ML workloads
- `a100`: NVIDIA A100 (40GB VRAM) - For large models and high-performance computing

Notes:
- Each instance comes with one GPU by default
- Contact support for multi-GPU configurations

#### Template Configuration

Create an instance with a predefined template:

```bash
tnr create --template <template_name>
```

Available templates:
- `ollama`: Sets up an Ollama server environment
- `comfy-ui`: Configures ComfyUI for AI image generation

Note: After creating an instance with a template, start the server using `<template_name>-start` when connected to the instance.

### Start an Instance

Start an existing inactive instance:

```bash
tnr start <instance_ID>
```

### Stop an Instance

Stop a running instance:

```bash
tnr stop <instance_ID>
```

### Delete an Instance

Remove an instance entirely:

```bash
tnr delete <instance_ID>
```

## Connectivity

### Connect to an Instance

Basic connection:

```bash
tnr connect <instance_ID>
```

This connects you to a running instance (default ID: 0). It's a wrapper for SSH - you can also manually SSH using the IP displayed in the status command.

### Port Forwarding

Connect with port forwarding:

```bash
tnr connect <instance_ID> -t PORT1 -t PORT2
```

Features:
- Tunnels specified ports from the remote instance to your local machine
- Specify multiple ports using -t/--tunnel flag repeatedly
- Example: `tnr connect 0 -t 8000 -t 8080` forwards ports 8000 and 8080
- Useful for accessing remote web servers, APIs, or other network services locally

## Storage Management

### Resize Disk

Increase persistent storage:

```bash
tnr resize <instance_ID> <new_size_GB>
```

Notes:
- Default storage is 100GB
- Disk size can only be increased, not decreased
- For smaller disk needs, create a new instance
- Contact support for region-specific storage requirements

## Authentication

### Login

```bash
tnr login
```

This prompts you to generate an API token, saved in `~/.thunder/token`

### Logout

```bash
tnr logout
```

Deletes the API token file without affecting environment variables.

### API Tokens

- Generate and manage tokens in the [console](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings/tokens)
- Tokens don't expire but can be revoked
- Use separate tokens for different devices
- For Docker/environments, set the `TNR_API_TOKEN` environment variable

## Status Commands

### Check Instance Status

View all instances:

```bash
tnr status
```

Monitor status changes:

```bash
tnr status --wait
```

## File Transfer

### Copy Files

Transfer files between local and remote instances:

```bash
tnr scp <source_path> <destination_path>
```

Usage notes:
- Remote paths: Use `instance_id:path` (e.g., `0:/home/user/data`)
- Local paths: Use standard format (e.g., `./data` or `/home/user/file.txt`)
- Must specify one remote path and one local path

Examples:
```bash
# Upload
tnr scp ./local_file.txt 0:/remote/path/

# Download
tnr scp 0:/remote/file.txt ./local_path/
```

Additional details:
- 60 second connection timeout
- Automatic SSH key setup
- Built-in compression
- Automatic `~/` expansion
