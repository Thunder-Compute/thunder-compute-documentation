## Account Management

### Login

Authenticate the CLI, which provides a link to the [console](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings?tab=tokens) where you can generate an API token.

```bash
tnr login
```

Under the hood, this generates and saves an API token to `~/.thunder/token`. You can store a token file here to programmatically authenticate, or by setting the `TNR_API_TOKEN` environment variable in your shell.

### Logout

Log out of the CLI with:

```bash
tnr logout
```

This deletes the stored API token.

### API Token Management

- Generate/manage tokens in the [console](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings?tab=tokens)
- Tokens never expire but can be revoked
- Use unique tokens per device

## Managing Instances

### Create an Instance

Create a new Thunder Compute instance:

```bash
tnr create
```

This creates a new instance with default configuration and automatically assigns an instance ID.

#### CPU Configuration

Configure custom vCPU count:

```bash
tnr create --vcpus <vcpu_count>
```

Each vCPU comes with 4GB of RAM. For example, a 4 core instance has 16GB of RAM, and an 8 core instance has 32GB of RAM.

<Note>
  By default, 4 vCPUs are included with your instance. Additional vCPUs are
  billed hourly at the rates shown [here](https://www.thundercompute.com/pricing)
</Note>

#### GPU Configuration

Specify a GPU type:

```bash
tnr create --gpu <gpu_type>
```

Available GPU types:

- `t4`: NVIDIA T4 (16GB VRAM) - Best for most ML workloads
- `a100` (default): NVIDIA A100 (40GB VRAM) - For large models and high-performance computing
- `a100xl` : NVIDIA A100 (80GB VRAM) - For even larger models, the biggest and the best

You can use the `--num-gpus` flag to specify multiple GPU configurations:

```bash
tnr create --gpu <gpu_type> --num-gpus <n>
```

#### Template Configuration

Templates make it easy to quickly launch common AI tools. Your instance will already be configured with everything you need to get running to generate images, run an LLM, and more.

To use a template, add the `--template` flag when creating an instance:

```bash
tnr create --template <template_name>
```

Available templates:

- `ollama`: Ollama server environment
- `comfy-ui`: ComfyUI for AI image generation
- `webui-forge`: WebUI Forge for Stable Diffusion

After instance creation, start the server using `start-<template_name>` when connected. For example:

```bash
start-ollama
```

### Stop an Instance

Stops a running instance.

```bash
tnr stop <instance_ID>
```

<Note>
  Stopped instances continue to accrue storage cost.
</Note>

### Start an Instance

Starts a stopped instance.

```bash
tnr start <instance_ID>
```

### Delete an Instance

```bash
tnr delete <instance_ID>
```

<Warning>
  This action permanently removes an instance and all associated data.
</Warning>

## Using instances

### Connect to an Instance

Use the `connect` command to access your instance. This wraps SSH, managing keys while automatically setting up everything you need to get started.

```bash
tnr connect <instance_ID>
```

The instance must be running before you can connect to it. See if the instance is running and get the instance ID (default `0`) with `tnr status`.

### Port Forwarding

Connect with port forwarding with the `-t` or `--tunnel` flag:

```bash
tnr connect <instance_ID> -t PORT1 -t PORT2
```

Features:

- Forward multiple ports using repeated `-t/--tunnel` flags
- Example: `tnr connect 0 -t 8000 -t 8080` forwards both ports 8000 and 8080
- Enables local access to remote web servers, APIs, and services

### Copy Files

Transfer files between local and remote instance with the `scp` command:

```bash
tnr scp <source_path> <destination_path>
```

You can transfer files in either direction, from your local machine to an instance, or from the instance to your local machine. You indicate the direction of transfer with the path format, shown below.

Path format:

- Remote: `instance_id:path` (e.g., `0:/home/user/data`)
- Local: Standard paths (e.g., `./data` or `/home/user/file.txt`)
- Must specify exactly one remote and one local path
- Paths can be either absolute or relative.

Examples:

```bash
# Upload to instance
tnr scp ./local_file.txt 0:/remote/path/

# Download from instance
tnr scp 0:/remote/file.txt ./local_path/
```

<Note>
  File transfers have a 60-second connection timeout. SSH key setup,
  compression, and `~/` expansion are handled automatically.
</Note>

## Managing Snapshots

Snapshots capture the state of a stopped instance's disk, allowing you to create new instances from that point in time.

### Create a Snapshot

Create a snapshot from a stopped instance:

```bash
tnr snapshot <instance_ID> <snapshot_name>
```

- `<instance_ID>`: The ID of the instance to snapshot. The instance must be stopped.
- `<snapshot_name>`: A unique name for your snapshot.
  - Must contain only lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and hyphens (-).
  - Must be between 1 and 62 characters long.

Snapshots are stored compressed to save space. You can view the compressed size using the `--list` command after creation.

<Note>
  You can use a snapshot as a template to launch new instances. The snapshot
  defines the initial disk content and size. While you can modify other
  configuration options (like vCPU count or GPU type) during the `tnr create`
  command, the new instance's disk size must be equal to or greater than the
  original instance's disk size. Decreasing the disk size is not supported.
</Note>

```bash
tnr create --template <snapshot_name> [--gpu <new_gpu_type>] #etc
```

### List Snapshots

List all available snapshots and their details, including compressed size:

```bash
tnr snapshot --list
```

### Delete a Snapshot

Delete a specific snapshot by name:

```bash
tnr snapshot --delete <snapshot_name>
```

<Warning>
  This action permanently deletes the snapshot. It does not affect instances
  created from this snapshot.
</Warning>

## System Management

### Modify Instance

Modify the instance's vCPU count, GPU type, or disk size:

```bash
tnr modify <instance_ID> \
  --disk-size-gb <new_size_GB> \
  --gpu <new_gpu_type> \
  --vcpus <new_vcpu_count>
```

All flags are optional, but at least one change must be provided.

These changes will affect the billing price of the instance.

Instances must be stopped to modify the vCPU count or GPU type. You can resize disk at any time.

<Warning>
  Storage can only be increased, not decreased. For smaller storage needs,
  create a new instance and transfer your files.
</Warning>

### View Instance Status

List all instances and details including `instance_ID`, `IP Address`, `Disk Size`, `GPU Type`, `GPU Count`, `vCPU Count`, `RAM`, and `Template`:

```bash
tnr status
```

use the `--no-wait` flag to disable automatic monitoring for status updates
