## The Thunder Compute CLI (tnr)

The Thunder Compute CLI enables you to manage Thunder Compute instances from your local machine.

## Instance Operations

### Create an Instance

Create a new Thunder Compute instance:

```bash
tnr create
```

This creates a new instance with default configuration and automatically assigns an instance ID.

#### CPU Configuration

Configure custom vCPU count:

```bash
tnr create --vcpus <vcpu_count>
```

<Note>
  We recommend using the default 4 vCPU configuration for most use cases.
  Additional vCPUs are billed proportionally, with RAM scaling at 4GB per vCPU.
</Note>

#### GPU Configuration

Specify a GPU type:

```bash
tnr create --gpu <gpu_type>
```

Available GPU types:

- `t4` (default): NVIDIA T4 (16GB VRAM) - Best for most ML workloads
- `a100`: NVIDIA A100 (40GB VRAM) - For large models and high-performance computing
- `a100xl` : NVIDIA A100 (80GB VRAM) - For even larger models, the biggest and the best

<Note>
  Each instance includes one GPU by default. Contact support for multi-GPU
  configurations.
</Note>

#### Template Configuration

Create an instance with a predefined environment:

```bash
tnr create --template <template_name>
```

Available templates:

- `ollama`: Ollama server environment
- `comfy-ui`: ComfyUI for AI image generation
- `webui-forge`: WebUI Forge for Stable Diffusion

<Note>
After instance creation, start the server using `<template_name>-start` when connected.
</Note>

### Start an Instance

```bash
tnr start <instance_ID>
```

Activates an existing inactive instance.

### Stop an Instance

```bash
tnr stop <instance_ID>
```

Stops a running instance.

### Delete an Instance

```bash
tnr delete <instance_ID>
```

<Warning>
  This action permanently removes an instance and all associated data.
</Warning>

## Remote Access and Transfer

### Connect to an Instance

Basic connection:

```bash
tnr connect <instance_ID>
```

Connects to a running instance (default ID: 0). Functions as an SSH wrapper - you can also use standard SSH with the IP shown in `tnr status`.

### Port Forwarding

Connect with port forwarding:

```bash
tnr connect <instance_ID> -t PORT1 -t PORT2
```

Features:

- Forward multiple ports using repeated -t/--tunnel flags
- Example: `tnr connect 0 -t 8000 -t 8080` forwards both ports 8000 and 8080
- Enables local access to remote web servers, APIs, and services

### Copy Files

Transfer files between local and remote instances:

```bash
tnr scp <source_path> <destination_path>
```

Path format:

- Remote: `instance_id:path` (e.g., `0:/home/user/data`)
- Local: Standard paths (e.g., `./data` or `/home/user/file.txt`)
- Must specify exactly one remote and one local path

Examples:

```bash
# Upload to instance
tnr scp ./local_file.txt 0:/remote/path/

# Download from instance
tnr scp 0:/remote/file.txt ./local_path/
```

<Note>
  File transfers have a 60-second connection timeout. SSH key setup,
  compression, and `~/` expansion are handled automatically.
</Note>

## System Management

### Modify Instance

Modify the instance's vCPU & GPU type or disk size:

```bash
tnr modify <instance_ID> \
  --disk-size-gb <new_size_GB> \
  --gpu <new_gpu_type> \
  --vcpus <new_vcpu_count>
```

All flags are optional, but at least one change must be provided.

<Note>
  You can only modify the vCPU & GPU type of the instance while it's stopped.
  You can resize the disk size regardless of the instance's state. These changes
  will effect the billing price of the instance.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Storage can only be increased, not decreased. For smaller storage needs,
  create a new instance.
</Warning>

### View Instance Status

List all instances:

```bash
tnr status
```

Monitor status changes:

```bash
tnr status --wait
```

## Account Management

### Login

```bash
tnr login
```

Generates and saves an API token to `~/.thunder/token`

### Logout

```bash
tnr logout
```

Removes the stored API token.

### API Token Management

- Generate/manage tokens: [console](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings/tokens)
- Tokens never expire but can be revoked
- Use unique tokens per device
