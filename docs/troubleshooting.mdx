## Common solutions

1.  Reconnect to the instance with `ctrl + d` and `tnr connect <instance_id>`
2.  Upgrade tnr with `pip install tnr --upgrade` on your local machine
3.  Restart the instance by running `tnr stop <instance_id>` and `tnr start <instance_id>`

## Common errors

### Path or permissions issues (Common on Windows)

To avoid path and permissions issues, we recommend using Linux/WSL wherever possible. Otherwise, a few steps resolve most issues:

1. Install tnr with the `--user` flag, i.e. `pip install tnr --user`
2. Ensure your user scripts directory is added to path and restart your shell
3. If all else fails, run your shell as an administrator and `$ pip install tnr`

### Function not implemented

A common error you may encounter is some variant of "This function is not implemented." What this means is that your program touches a portion of the CUDAÂ API that we do not currently support. If you encounter this, please contact us.

### SSH errors

Sometimes, instances will encounter SSH-related errors, such as `Error reading SSH protocol banner`. To resolve these, restart your instance with `tnr stop <instance_id>` and `tnr start <instance_id>`
