## Common solutions

1.  Reconnect to the instance with `ctrl + d` and `tnr connect <instance_id>`
2.  Upgrade tnr with `pip install tnr --upgrade` on your local machine
3.  Restart the instance by running `tnr stop <instance_id>` and `tnr start <instance_id>` (full documentation in [CLI operations](/docs/cli-reference))

## Logs

To assist troubleshooting, the GCP/AWS instance logs for each instance are saved to the file `/var/log/syslog`. On your local machine, you can view the logs with `cat ~/.thunder/logs`.

## Common errors

### Path or permissions issues (Common on Windows)

To avoid path and permissions issues, we recommend using WSL instead of Windows. Otherwise, a few steps resolve most issues:

1. Install tnr with the `--user` flag, i.e. `pip install tnr --user`
2. Ensure your user scripts directory is added to path and restart your shell
3. If all else fails, run your shell as an administrator and `$ pip install tnr`

If issues persist, consider using WSL or contact our team for support.

### Function not implemented

A common error you may encounter is some variant of "This function is not implemented." What this means is that your program touches a portion of the CUDA API that we do not currently support. Check our [compatibility guide](/docs/compatibility) for supported features, and if you encounter this, please contact us.

### SSH errors

If you encounter SSH-related errors (like `Error reading SSH protocol banner` or permission issues), see our detailed [SSH Troubleshooting Guide](/guides/troubleshooting-ssh-errors) for step-by-step solutions. For quick fixes, try restarting your instance with `tnr stop <instance_id>` and `tnr start <instance_id>`.
