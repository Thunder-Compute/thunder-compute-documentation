## Common solutions

1.  Reconnect to the instance with `ctrl + d` and `tnr connect <instance_id>`
2.  Upgrade tnr with `pip install tnr --upgrade` on your local machine
3.  Restart the instance by running `tnr stop <instance_id>` and `tnr start <instance_id>`

## Common errors

### Windows installation

Managing python packages with Windows can be troublesome. Whenever possible, we recommend using WSL. Otherwise, a few steps resolve most issues:

1. Install tnr with the `--user` flag, i.e. `pip install tnr --user`
2. Ensure your user scripts directory is added to path and restart your shell
3. If all else fails, run powershell or cmd as an administrator during installation

### Function not implemented

A common error you may encounter is some variant of "This function is not implemented." What this means is that your program touches a portion of the CUDAÂ API that we do not currently support. If you encounter this, please contact us.

### GPU not available

Occasionally, you may find an error where a library says that a GPU or GPU driver is not available.

Most frequently, this is because the library is statically linked to CUDA, which prevents it from recognizing a Thunder Compute virtual GPU. To resolve this, try the following steps:

1. Check if the library is statically linked to CUDA. If so, check for an older version of the library that is dynamically linked to CUDA
2. Contact Thunder Compute support

### SSH errors

Sometimes, instances will encounter SSH-related errors, such as `Error reading SSH protocol banner`. To resolve these, restart your instance with `tnr stop <instance_id>` and `tnr start <instance_id>`
