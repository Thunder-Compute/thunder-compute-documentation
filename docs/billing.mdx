## Payment Method Requirement

We require a payment method on file for every Thunder Compute account. This helps us verify users and prevent fraud while still giving you $20 in free credit to try things out. You won’t be charged unless you exceed that free credit.

## Billing Alerts

- **Instance reminders:** We’ll email you about any running instances so you’re never caught off guard.
- **Threshold charges:** As your usage grows, we’ll bill your card at preset checkpoints (which rise over time) to prevent runaway bills.

## Our rates

All compute resources are billed per minute only while your instances run. Storage incurs charges even when instances are stopped. For current rates, see our [pricing page](https://thundercompute.com/pricing).

## Money-Saving Tips

While Thunder Compute is already the cheapest GPU cloud platform, there are a few strategies we recommend to reduce your bill:

- Turn off instances when you’re done.
- Right‑size with `tnr modify` to match your workload.
- Delete instances you no longer need.
- Use snapshots to compress long‑term data.

We think this balances a smooth experience with strong verification—but if you have feedback or questions, please hop into our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/nwuETS9jJK). We’re always happy to improve\!
