## The Thunder Compute CLI (tnr)

You install the Thunder Compute CLI on your local machine. From there, you can manage Thunder Compute instances.

### Start/create an instance

- `$ tnr create`
  - Creates a new Thunder Compute instance and automatically assigns an instance ID
- `$ tnr start [instance_ID]`
  - Starts an inactive Thunder Compute instance
- `$ tnr create --vcpus [vcpu_count]` (not necessary for most use cases)
  - For most use cases, we highly recommend using the default 4 vCPU configuration. Additional vCPUs are billed proportionally.
  - Creates a new Thunder Compute instance with a set number of vCPUs. RAM scales according to how many vCPUs you have (`4 * vCPU count`)
- `$ tnr create --gpu [gpu_type]` (default: `t4`)
  - Available GPU types:
    - `t4`: NVIDIA T4 (16GB VRAM) - Best for most ML workloads
    - `a100`: NVIDIA A100 (80GB VRAM) - For large models and high-performance computing
  - Each instance comes with one GPU by default
  - Contact support for multi-GPU configurations

### Stop/delete an instance

- `$ tnr stop [instance_ID]`
  - Stops a running Thunder Compute instance
- `$ tnr delete [instance_ID]`
  - Deletes a Thunder Compute instance

### Connect to a running instance

- `$ tnr connect [instance_ID]`

  - Connects you to a running Thunder Compute instance (default 0)
  - This is a wrapper on SSHing. You can also manually SSH if desired using the IP displayed in `$ tnr status`

- `$ tnr connect [instance_ID] -t PORT1 -t PORT2`
  - Connects you to a running Thunder Compute instance and sets up port forwarding
  - Tunnels specified ports from the remote instance to your local machine
  - Can specify multiple ports using -t/--tunnel flag repeatedly
  - Example: `$ tnr connect 0 -t 8000 -t 8080` forwards ports 8000 and 8080 to respective ports on your local machine
  - Useful for accessing remote web servers, APIs, or other network services running on an instance locally

### Resize a disk

- `$ tnr resize [instance_ID] [new_size_GB]`
  - Increases the persistent disk size of an instance to `new_size_GB`
  - This is not reversible and persistent disk sizes can only be increased. If you would like a smaller disk, delete your existing instance and create a new one

By default, instances have 100GB of persistent storage. If you have significant amounts of data in a storage bucket and are constrained to a specific region or cloud provider, contact our support team.

### Authentication

- `$ tnr login`
  - Logs in to Thunder Compute, prompting you to generate an API token which is saved in `~/.thunder/token`
- `$ tnr logout`
  - Deletes the Thunder Compute API token file. Does not affect environment variables

If your environment requires authentication with an environment variable, most commonly when using Docker, you can set the `TNR_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

You can generate and manage single-use API tokens in the [console](https://console.thundercompute.com/settings/tokens). API tokens do not expire and you can revoke them at any time. To access Thunder Compute from multiple devices, generate separate API tokens for each device.

### Status

- `$ tnr status`
  - On a local machine: Lists all TNRÂ instances associated with your Thunder Compute account
  - In a managed instance: Displays which GPUs are currently using processes and their runtime

### Copy files to/from an instance

- `$ tnr scp [source_path] [destination_path]`
  - Copies files or directories between your local machine and Thunder instances
  - For remote paths, use format `instance_id:path` (e.g., `0:/home/user/data`)
  - For local paths, use normal file paths (e.g., `./data` or `/home/user/file.txt`)
  - Must specify exactly one remote path and one local path
  - Examples:
    - Upload: `$ tnr scp ./local_file.txt 0:/remote/path/`
    - Download: `$ tnr scp 0:/remote/file.txt ./local_path/`
  - There is a 60 second connection timeout
  - SSH key setup, compression, and `~/` expansion are automatically handled
