## Officially supported libraries

The following libraries and tools are officially supported

* PyTorch
* TensorFlow
* PyTorch Lightning
* Hugging Face
* CuPy (version `12.3.0` and older, see below)

Note: make sure you install the cuda-compatible version of these libraries, e.g., `tensorflow[and-cuda]`. The cuda-compatible PyTorch binary is pre-installed on every Thunder Compute instance.

You can create and manage Thunder Compute instances with the `tnr` command line interface from any major operating system. Within a Thunder Compute instance, The following interfaces are officially supported:

* Jupyter Notebooks
* IPython
* Anaconda
* Docker

## Known incompatibilities

Currently, Thunder Compute lacks official support for the following use cases. If you would like to run one of the following on Thunder Compute, please contact us and we will try our best to help!

* Graphics workloads (OpenGL, Vulkan, Blender, others)
* Multi-node training
* Libraries that are statically linked to CUDA (if possible, find an older version of the same library that is dynamically linked to CUDA)

## Cryptocurrency mining

Mining, staking, or otherwise interacting with cryptocurrency is strictly prohibited on Thunder Compute. If cryptocurrency-related activity is detected, the associated account is immediately banned from Thunder Compute and the monthly billing credit is revoked. The account is then billed for the full amount of usage. 

## Compatibility notes

### CuPy

The latest versions of CuPy are statically linked to CUDA, which prevents them from recognizing a Thunder Compute virtual GPU. To run CuPy on Thunder Compute, please use an older version (`12.3.0` or earlier) which is dynamically linked to CUDA.

To install a working version of CuPy, please use the following installation command:

`pip install cupy-cuda12x==12.3.0`
