## Supported functionality

The following libraries and tools are known to be supported

* PyTorch
* TensorFlow
* PyTorch Lightning
* Hugging Face
* CuPy (version `12.3.0` and older, see below)

You can create and manage Thunder Compute instances with the `tnr` command line interface from any major operating system.

The following interfaces are officially supported from within a Thunder Compute instance:

* Jupyter Notebooks
* IPython
* Anaconda
* Docker

## Known incompatibilities

Currently, Thunder Compute lacks support for the following use cases. If you would like to run one of the following on Thunder Compute, please contact us and we will try our best to help!

* Graphics workloads (OpenGL, Vulkan, Blender, others)
* Multi-node training
* Libraries that are statically linked to CUDA (if possible, find an older version of the same library that is dynamically linked to CUDA)

## Compatibility notes

### CuPy

The latest versions of CuPy are statically linked to CUDA, which prevents them from recognizing a Thunder Compute virtual GPU. To run CuPy on Thunder Compute, please use an older version (`12.3.0` or earlier) which is dynamically linked to CUDA.

To install a working version of CuPy, please use the following installation command:

`pip install cupy-cuda12x==12.3.0`
