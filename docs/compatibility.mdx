## CuPy

The latest versions of CuPy are statically linked to CUDA, which prevents them from recognizing a Thunder Compute virtual GPU. To run CuPy on Thunder Compute, please use an older version (`12.3.0 or earlier`) which is dynamically linked to CUDA.

Use the following installation command:

`pip install cupy-cuda12x==12.3.0`
