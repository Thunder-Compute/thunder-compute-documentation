## Supported functionality

The following libraries and tools are known to be supported

* PyTorch
* TensorFlow
* PyTorch Lightning
* Hugging Face

## Compatibility fixes

The latest versions of CuPy are statically linked to CUDA, which prevents them from recognizing a Thunder Compute virtual GPU. To run CuPy on Thunder Compute, please use an older version (`12.3.0` or earlier) which is dynamically linked to CUDA.

To install a working version of CuPy, please use the following installation command:

`pip install cupy-cuda12x==12.3.0`

## Known incompatibilities

Currently, Thunder Compute lacks support for the following use cases. If you would like to run one of the following on Thunder Compute, please contact us and we will try our best to help!

* Graphics workloads (OpenGL, Vulkan, Blender, others)
* Multi-node training
