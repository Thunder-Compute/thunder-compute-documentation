## Common solutions

1.  Reconnect to the instance with `ctrl + d` and `tnr connect <instance_id>`
2.  Upgrade tnr. Depending on your install method, you may have to use `pip install tnr --upgrade` or re-download the binary from the website
3.  Restart the instance by running `tnr stop <instance_id>` and `tnr start <instance_id>` (full documentation in [CLI operations](/docs/cli-reference))

## Logs

To assist troubleshooting, the GCP/AWS instance logs for each instance are saved to the file `/var/log/syslog`. On your local machine, you can view the CLI logs with `cat ~/.thunder/logs`. Sharing these with our team can help us quickly find a solution for your problem.

## Common errors

### Function not implemented

A common error you may encounter is some variant of "This function is not implemented." What this means is that your program touches a portion of the CUDA API that we do not currently support. Check our [prototyping mode guide](/docs/prototyping-mode) for supported features, and if you encounter this, please contact us.

### SSH errors

If you encounter SSH-related errors (like `Error reading SSH protocol banner` or permission issues), first retry the command.

For quick fixes, try restarting your instance with `tnr stop <instance_id>` and `tnr start <instance_id>`.

For persistent SSH issues, see our [SSH on Thunder Compute guide](/guides/ssh-on-thunder-compute) for alternative connection methods.

## Recommended Guides

To help prevent common issues and get the most out of Thunder Compute, we recommend these guides:

* [Using Docker](/guides/using-docker-on-thundercompute) - Learn about GPU-enabled containers and troubleshooting Docker issues
* [Installing Conda](/guides/installing-conda) - Proper setup of Conda environments to avoid dependency conflicts
* [Using Instance Templates](/guides/using-instance-templates) - Use pre-configured environments to minimize setup issues

## Production mode as a last resort

If you continue to experience compatibility issues or errors that cannot be resolved through the above methods, consider switching to [Production mode](/docs/production-mode). Production mode provides maximum stability and reliability with all low-level optimizations disabled, ensuring complete compatibility for workloads that encounter persistent issues in the prototyping tier.

To switch to production mode:
```
tnr modify <instance_id> --mode production
```

Note that production mode has a higher hourly cost but guarantees predictable performance and compatibility.
